       "[b\"SoftBank's $100 Billion Tech Fund Rankles VCs as Valuations Soar:\\xc2\\xa0In the months since Softbank Group Corp. unveiled plans for a $100 billion technology fund, the Japanese company has been making its presence deeply felt across the industry. The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources,\\xc2\\xa0clout\\xc2\\xa0and name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest\\xc2\\xa0digital-payments\\xc2\\xa0startup. The deal boosted Paytm's valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That's not outlandish given\\xc2\\xa0Paytm's\\xc2\\xa0dominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there's the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won't budge; it's a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son's strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo,\\xc2\\xa0Alibaba\\xc2\\xa0and Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted.\\xc2\\xa0\",\n",
       " b'Quora tests video answers to steal Q&A from YouTube:\\xc2\\xa0Newly-minted unicorn Quora has even bigger ambitions than text questions-and-answers. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to let video giants or startups disrupt its future.\\xc2\\xa0This week Quora began testing video answers, because sometimes it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot easier to show someone how something works, the best way to complete a task, or why one thing is better than another than try to write it out for them. Users in the beta group will be able to record videos on iOS or Android as supplements or complete answers that everyone on Quora can watch. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s considering allowing video uploads, which might offer more polished content but increase spam concerns.

By the end of August, all of the taxis in Washington have to tear out their traditional meters and start using smartphones or tablets, in what the city government has been describing as a complete reimagining of how the cab system works.\\xc2\\xa0For Square, the deal reflects an increasing focus on becoming the payment platform for a range of other company's mobile applications, websites and point-of-sale devices. No money is changing hands between the company and the city. Square agreed to satisfy the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s requirement that drivers give up no more than 2.65 percent of their fares in transaction fees, according to the department. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lower than the standard 2.75 commission it usually takes and significantly less than the 3.5 percent to 5 percent commission that drivers currently pay to use the mechanical meters, according to Ernest\\xc2\\xa0Chrappah, the director of the city's taxi regulator. \\xc2\\xa0Chrappah said the lower fees will help make it easier for cabbies to sustain themselves.

The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies,\\xc2\\xa0automakers\\xc2\\xa0and start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaymo\\xc2\\xa0L.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files from\\xc2\\xa0Waymo\\xc2\\xa0immediately before leaving his employment there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0He added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSignificantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of\\xc2\\xa0Waymo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xc2\\xa0confidential files.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Judge Alsup also ruled that\\xc2\\xa0Waymo\\xc2\\xa0significantly \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverreached\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeneral approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not \\xe2\\x80\\x98secret,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowski\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing.

Because Using Bitcoin Is Hard:\\xc2\\xa0An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t paid hackers a ransom.\\xc2\\xa0After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because the\\xc2\\xa0crypto currency\\xc2\\xa0is harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t backed up their data.\\xc2\\xa0As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise. \\xc2\\xa0Paying a ransom isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, the\\xc2\\xa0crypto currency\\xc2\\xa0is a black box for most people.\\xc2\\xa0\"If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to start with that,\" said James Smith, the\\xc2\\xa0CEO\\xc2\\xa0and co-founder of Elliptic.\\xc2\\xa0There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency.\\xc2\\xa0Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. \"It looks like a long garbled string of text,\" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer.\\xc2\\xa0\"A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,\" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin.\\xc2\\xa0One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows.\\xc2\\xa0More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. \"Quite often they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,\" he said. \"It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer.\"',\n",

The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector.\\xc2\\xa0After a Liberal-led coalition was elected in 2013, that party looked for ways to contain costs and speed up the rollout. They focused on what in the telecommunications industry is called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe last mile\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the wires that connect a home or business with the broader network. While the National Broadband Network initially envisioned high-speed fiber connecting homes and businesses directly to the network, the Liberal-led effort compromised by connecting them with existing copper wire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 basically, the same technology used in the earliest days of the telephone. The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.',\n",
       " b'The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger:\\xc2\\xa0Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station?\\xc2\\xa0A. If you have ever backed up your phone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the device\\xe2\\x80\\x99s battery. The concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjuice-jacking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection \\xe2\\x80\\x94 perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls.\\xc2\\xa0If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, a\\xc2\\xa0product-recommendation\\xc2\\xa0site owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there).\\xc2\\xa0Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.',\n",

It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up.\\xc2\\xa0Stitch Fix\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you.\\xc2\\xa0When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing\\xc2\\xa0needs\\xc2\\xa0and price points. The start-up\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 most of them part time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box.\\xc2\\xa0Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted.\\xc2\\xa0But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around.

The speakers feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, which users can tell to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights.\\xc2\\xa0That puts it far ahead of Alphabet Inc's Google Home, a similar gadget that has a 23.8 percent share, and less successful offerings from other tech companies. The number of active U.S. users will more than double for the devices this year, to 35.6 million, eMarketer said.\\xc2\\xa0The report underscores Amazon's progress in making Alexa and its speech-recognition technology an integral part of customers' lives.

       " b'Virtual Reality Companies Navigate \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Trough of Disillusionment\\xe2\\x80\\x99:\\xc2\\xa0Twelve months ago the Virtual Reality World Congress in Bristol, England, was a sell-out show, with over 750 attendees gawping over the latest VR hardware and production techniques. This year\\'s event, which took place last week,\\xc2\\xa0attracted even more\\xc2\\xa0participants -- more than 1,200 over three days -- but the mood felt decidedly less upbeat. Virtual reality, it seems, has been mugged by reality. Sales of VR hardware have fallen 40 percent behind forecasts, CCS Insight, a technology research group, said in a February report. And the VR hardware that is selling has mostly been relatively inexpensive goggles that allow people to experience VR through their smartphones, such as Samsung\\'s Gear VR and Google\\'s Daydream, not higher-end, dedicated headsets such as those made by Sony Corp, Facebook Inc.\\'s Oculus and HTC Corp. Many working in VR have run up against the hard economic reality of trying to produce content for a technology that remains, at least for the moment, fairly niche. As disappointment is setting in for virtual reality, expectations are building around its less glamorous cousin, augmented reality, which is also sometimes called mixed reality because it places digitally-rendered elements in the real observed environment. In 2016, Pokemon Go, which is an augmented reality game played on smartphones, became a worldwide phenomenon. Microsoft launched its high-end AR headset, HoloLens, which has found customers mostly among industrial and business users -- such as aeronautical engineers and architects. Snap Inc.\\'s AR photo filters are one of the most popular features of its messaging service and Facebook has announced a big push into the field with its own AR camera filters. \\xc2\\xa0Many now expect Apple Inc. to introduce an augmented reality product in the next year, which might help AR to leapfrog VR to achieve mass adoption. Technology company ABI Research says that virtual reality currently generates about 50 percent more revenue than augmented reality but that it relies heavily on hardware sales. Augmented reality, by contrast, relies more on software and in many cases can be experienced by users with their existing smartphones. ABI forecasts that AR revenues will surpass VR sales by 2019. Virtual reality true believers, like Taylor, are dismissive of the idea that AR might outrun VR as a blockbuster consumer technology. Augmented reality requires too much training for the average consumer to learn how to integrate the digital images into the real world, Taylor said. \"Mixing the virtual world and the real world is less natural,\" he said. Simply popping on a headset and diving into a completely virtual environment is, somewhat counter-intuitively, easier, he said. ABI Research still forecasts that virtual reality device shipments will reach 110 million units by 2021 -- huge growth considering only about 6.3 million such devices were shipped last year, according to tech research company Super Data.\\xc2\\xa0',\n",

Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading.\\xc2\\xa0For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engineers.

So Mr. Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.\\xc2\\xa0But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion.\\xc2\\xa0Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick.

Ford sold 6.6 million cars in 2016. GM sold 10 million. Tesla sold a paltry 76,000. Ford and GM both turned healthy profits in 2016.

Because Tesla cars are purely electric, a single car needs about 1,000 times as much battery capacity as a typical smartphone. So making electric cars a mainstream technology will require producing batteries on a scale that dwarfs today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s production for smartphones and other portable gadgets.\\xc2\\xa0A major test of this will come in Tesla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s release of the Model 3 later this year. These cars will be powered by batteries from the Gigafactory, a huge factory Tesla has constructed in the Nevada desert. If the Model 3 is a hit, experts say, the Gigafactory will ensure Tesla has plenty of batteries to meet demand for this relatively affordable mass-market vehicle. Other car companies would have to scramble \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not only to design a similar stylish\\xc2\\xa0vehicle,\\xc2\\xa0but also to find suppliers for yet more batteries.\\xc2\\xa0Experts say this battery advantage won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last forever \\xe2\\x80\\x94 other battery makers might be able to catch up within a year or two. But having a year or two head start could make a big difference \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not only cementing Tesla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation as the leading electric car\\xc2\\xa0brand,\\xc2\\xa0but positioning Tesla to make further investments that could help it stay a step ahead of rivals down the road.',\n",

       " b\"Why Spotify\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IPO-less IPO is a smart\\xc2\\xa0idea:Here's\\xc2\\xa0a smart idea: In a traditional IPO, the company listing the stock sells shares to a bunch of institutional investors, like hedge funds and pension funds, at an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinitial offering price.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0The next day, those institutional investors sell those shares on an open exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. This is when regular folks can buy shares, but at a higher price than the IPO. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what generates the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpop,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you always read about on IPO day. The pop also comes since the institutional investors should get a return for the risk they took in the IPO. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a recent, real-world example: Snap sold stock in its IPO last month for $17 a share. That means Snap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s early investors, like Benchmark, got $17 for every share they sold. But the next day, when those IPO investors sold shares on the NYSE, the stock traded at $24, a 41 percent pop above the IPO price.\\xc2\\xa0Every penny above $17 is a penny Snap and its early investors didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get. So you could argue the pop was bad for the early owners of Snap. They left 41 percent on the table.\\xc2\\xa0So you could see how Spotify CEO Daniel Ek might not want to go through the IPO process. Why give all that money to brokers, instead of people who own Spotify, like his investors, his employees and Ek himself? \\xc2\\xa0Instead, by listing directly, Spotify can skip the IPO pricing altogether and just sell shares on an open exchange.\\xc2\\xa0The conceit of a direct listing is that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more democratic, very logical, very internet. You can see the appeal to Ek.\\xc2\\xa0But there is a rationale for the IPO process too. By hiring underwriters, a company is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpre-selling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shares to qualified buyers. That assures the company will get something for its shares while also stoking interest in the open market.\\xc2\\xa0You might even argue that in the case of Snap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IPO it might not have even gotten $17 a share if they hadn't hired bankers to manage the sale. In effect, the bankers set a price range, then go to the big institutional investors to see where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bite before narrowing in on a set price. (Some analysts have pegged $15 as a fair value price for Snap shares.)\\xc2\\xa0Underwriters like Goldman Sachs are paid as much as 7 to 8 percent commission for their work, but companies can negotiate that down. In the case of Snap, it was about 2.5 to 3 percent, according to sources.\",\n",

Uber had planned to buy 15,000 new cars last year and lease them out in a bid to attract more drivers - a strategy it has used in other markets - but it suspended the scheme for a while in December after leasing just a third of that total.\\xc2\\xa0After burning through millions of dollars over three years in a battle for market share with local rival Ola, backed by Japan's Softbank, Uber has cut the incentives it gives to drivers and raised the fares it charges passengers.Two people with knowledge of the matter said Uber miscalculated the impact that the reduced incentives would have on drivers' earnings, especially those making lease payments.To lease a new small car through Uber's scheme, drivers pay a 33,000 rupee ($499) deposit - less than what they would pay to buy a car from a dealer with a bank loan. But weekly payments of about 5,500 rupees over three years add up to nearly double what drivers would pay to service a car loan.That wasn't an issue when incentives were high. Several Uber drivers said they feel trapped as a surge in the number of cars on Uber's platform has led to fewer rides, at a time when incentives have been cut, making it harder to keep up lease payments.\",\n",

A lot has changed in the space in the intervening years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 mostly for the worse, as overall sales have continued to slip. In Q4 of last year, IDC reported that shipments had dropped 20 percent, year over year, while Strategic Analytics has the number at half that. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room for debate as far as precisely how down the overall market is (not to mention what precisely qualifies a device as a tablet), but there seems to at least be a consensus that early predictions of the tablet space eclipsing PCs missed the mark.\\xc2\\xa0The space\\xc2\\xa0has suffered for a variety of reasons. Among them, the fact that users simply aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t refreshing tablets at a rate many manufacturers no doubt predicted.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe iPad 2 is still in use today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d IDC Senior Analyst Jitesh Ubrani tells TechCrunch. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe [original] iPad Minis and Air are all still in use today.

While US online retailer eBay, Chinese tech major Tencent and Microsoft are investing $500 million each in the round, the part-sale of Tiger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares would mean Flipkart is still short of the $1.5 billion it was targeting to raise in this round. That means either one of the three would put in additional money, or a fourth investor\\xe2\\x80\\x94potentially Google Capital\\xe2\\x80\\x94would help Flipkart close the round within a few weeks, added the person cited above. The part-sale of its Flipkart stake aligns with Tiger Global\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy to book some gains before actively investing in the country again, VCCircle had reported earlier. It is part of its broader plans to monetise stakes in its major bets, such as Flipkart,\\xc2\\xa0Ola\\xc2\\xa0and Quikr, in the near term.\\xc2\\xa0The secondary transaction of Flipkart shares between Tiger Global and Microsoft would result in the former\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stake in the company decreasing to around 25%, from the current 33-35%, depending on the deal size. This would also mean Tiger getting some of its money back\\xe2\\x80\\x94the firm is believed to have invested around $1 billion in Flipkart.\\xc2\\xa0This part-exit would mean three-fold return for Tiger Global\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest investment in India, better than some of its poor exits such as Caratlane last year, where it practically made no gains at all. Except MakeMyTrip and JustDial, Tiger has seen no impressive exits in India yet.',\n",

Fitbit in January announced it had missed earnings expectations and starting cutting jobs because sales were lower than expected.\\xc2\\xa0It's hard to say exactly what has caused the cool-down in wearables, but one possibility is that the market for uber-techy wearables that try to put a smartwatch on your wrist is pretty saturated. Analysts have pointed to a shift in the market away from the super-functional smartwatch toward gadgets that are a little more focused and better looking to boot.\",\n",

       " b'Valuation Shell Game: Silicon Valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Dirty Secret:\\xc2\\xa0You want to know the dirty, little secret of Silicon Valley? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called the 409A valuation.\\xc2\\xa0Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how the process works: In order to attract and to retain high-powered employees, high-flying tech companies want to issue them common stock or options. To do so and to comply with Internal Revenue Service rules, they need to obtain an independent, third-party valuation of the company.\\xc2\\xa0This type of valuation allows hot, privately owned technology companies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like Uber, Airbnb or Nextdoor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to issue common stock or stock options to employees at a low price and, at the same time, or nearly the same time, sell preferred stock to outside investors at a price that is often three or four times higher. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a way for company founders to control the market for the stock of their private companies while rewarding themselves and key employees with cheap shares that seem instantly worth a lot more than the price at which they were issued.\\xc2\\xa0Failure to comply with section 409A of the tax code would make employees receiving the stock grants personally liable for immediate taxation on the excess value embedded in the stock or options, plus a 20 percent penalty tax. The valuations also give the founders of technology companies extraordinary control over the market for the private sale of company stock. Whether employees realize it or not, the stock the company grants to them often explicitly prevents its sale to anyone, or in any private secondary market, without the express written consent of the founder, the chief executive or the board of directors. Obviously this becomes a problem when an employee wants to sell his or her private stock. And who wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, if for instance, the stock is issued to employees at a $500 million valuation, and then sold to outside investors at a $1.5 billion valuation.\\xc2\\xa0This is often the point where the founder steps in and says, sorry, no sale, or at least not at the higher valuation. Selling implies the person is no longer a true believer in the company or in its mission. This dynamic falls especially hard on early investors who are not company employees, those so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseries A\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseries B\\xe2\\x80\\x9d venture-capital investors who would like to sell at the higher valuation but can do so only with the founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or chief executive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s permission and only at the sanctioned valuation.

Then they did the math and discovered that this oversight was costing the company on average 35 cents a delivery.\\xc2\\xa0Instacart now charges the correct amount for bottle deposits. In the last year, it made a similar adjustment to how it accounts for local sales taxes, which has saved another 20 cents per delivery, according to the company.

The San Francisco-based company, which pays workers to pick up and deliver groceries from local supermarkets, is also eager to demonstrate that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking in more revenue while spending less.\\xc2\\xa0Instacart cut its burn rate by more than half in the past year, Mehta said. In addition to the bottle deposit and sales tax adjustments, the company focused on driving down \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctime per delivery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a metric that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the source of some obsession within the walls of Instacart.

Yet despite these successes, it seems the phone may be experiencing some trouble on the sales front and may have missed an opportunity to capitalize on competitors' missteps.\\xc2\\xa0While Google doesn't break out its numbers for Pixel units sold, analysts estimate that customers bought around 552,000 Pixel phones by the end of 2016, according to USA Today. In comparison, Apple sold 78 million iPhones between late September and December. Samsung sold 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones between its mid-August launch and its October discontinuation.\\xc2\\xa0To put that in perspective, Google's market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one percent worldwide \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as compared to Samsung's 18 percent and Apple's 18.2 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 said Ramon Llamas, a research manager for the analysis firm International Data Corporation.\\xc2\\xa0On paper, it seemed like it should have been a slam dunk for Google given the Pixel's Google branding, Samsung's Note 7 problems, and criticism of Apple's latest iPhones not being that revolutionary. The Pixel is a solid phone thanks to its quality construction, pure version of Android and special Google features such as the voice-controlled Assistant.\\xc2\\xa0The big problem for Pixel is that only one carrier, Verizon, sells the phone, said Jeff Moore of research firm Wave7 Research. While users can get it directly from Google for\\xc2\\xa0full\\xc2\\xa0price of $649 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and take it to another carrier if they want \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that's not an option that a majority of wireless customers think about.\\xc2\\xa0Compounding the availability issue, Moore said, is that stores are having trouble keeping the phones in stock.

Uber used these methods to evade the authorities in cities like Boston, Paris and Las Vegas, and in countries like Australia,\\xc2\\xa0China\\xc2\\xa0and South Korea.\\xc2\\xa0Greyball\\xc2\\xa0was part of a program called VTOS, short for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviolation of terms of service,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which Uber created to root out people it thought were using or targeting its service improperly.

One technique involved drawing a digital perimeter, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgeofence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around the government offices on a digital map of a city that Uber was monitoring. The company watched which people were frequently opening and closing the app \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a process known internally as eyeballing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 near such locations as evidence that the users might be associated with city agencies.\\xc2\\xa0Other techniques included looking at a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit card information and determining whether the card was tied directly to an institution like a police credit union.Enforcement officials involved in large-scale sting operations meant to catch Uber drivers would sometimes buy dozens of\\xc2\\xa0cellphones\\xc2\\xa0to create different accounts. To circumvent that tactic, Uber employees would go to local electronics stores to look up device numbers of the cheapest mobile phones for sale, which were often the ones bought by city officials working with budgets that were not large.\\xc2\\xa0In all, there were at least a dozen or so signifiers in the VTOS program that Uber employees could use to assess whether users were regular new riders or probably city officials.\\xc2\\xa0If such clues did not confirm a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity, Uber employees would search social media profiles and other information available online. If users were identified as being linked to law enforcement, Uber Greyballed them by tagging them with a small piece of code that read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreyball\\xe2\\x80\\x9d followed by a string of numbers.\\xc2\\xa0When someone tagged this way called a car, Uber could scramble a set of ghost cars in a fake version of the app for that person to see, or show that no cars were available. Occasionally, if a driver accidentally picked up someone tagged as an officer, Uber called the driver with instructions to end the ride.',\n",

       " b'Google and Uber Are Fighting Over Lidar Technology. What Is It?\\xc2\\xa0Lidar is a radar-like system that uses lasers instead of radio waves to build a 3-D image of the surrounding landscape. Since satellite navigation systems are only accurate to within 16 feet and can be easily flummoxed by high-rise and glass-fronted buildings, autonomous vehicles require an array of other sensors to position themselves precisely and maintain awareness of nearby pedestrians,\\xc2\\xa0vehicles\\xc2\\xa0and other objects. Lidar comprises a series of rotating, stacked lasers that shoot out at different angles. Each layer is called a\\xc2\\xa0channel,\\xc2\\xa0and is made up of two laser beams. The signal from each individual channel creates one contour line, and together, those lines generate a 3-D image of the surrounding environment. That means\\xc2\\xa0that,\\xc2\\xa0the more\\xc2\\xa0lasers\\xc2\\xa0in each stack, the higher the resolution. Velodyne, for instance, manufactures products with 16, 32 and 64 laser channels. The main hurdle to lidar becoming a widely adopted technology in mass-produced cars is cost. A 64-channel unit from Velodyne can cost more than $50,000, while the lower end 16-channel product sells for $7,999. Since a car might require several lidar units, it quickly makes the cost prohibitive for anything but the most expensive luxury cars. Velodyne and competitors such as Quanergy Systems Inc. are working to reduce the price. That would be accelerated by major orders for mass market cars.',\n",

Exploring that question helps explain how\\xc2\\xa0years-ago\\xc2\\xa0dealings with venture capitalists helped lead to this point.\\xc2\\xa0At the heart of that is a Lightspeed venture capitalist, Jeremy Liew, and the terms he embedded in his 2012 investment in what was then known as Snapchat. The terms gave Mr. Liew outsize power over the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future financing round. That ended up irking Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief executive, Mr. Spiegel, who took steps to reassert control over the company.The end result was a largely severed connection. Today, Lightspeed is listed in Snap\\xe2\\x80\\x99s I.P.O. prospectus as the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xc2\\xa0second biggest\\xc2\\xa0venture investor, with 86.6 million shares, or a stake of more than 8 percent, and Mr. Liew has appeared on television shows, podcasts and in\\xc2\\xa0technology\\xc2\\xa0publications to discuss Snap. Yet he and Snap no longer have close ties, and Mr. Spiegel has not had meetings or hung out with Mr. Liew since the early investment rounds.Mr. Liew and Mr. Spiegel met in March 2012, when Mr. Liew used Facebook to contact Mr. Spiegel, a Stanford University student who had recently started Snapchat with Mr. Murphy, a fraternity brother. At the meeting that followed, Mr. Spiegel said his father was tired of paying Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bills. Mr. Liew offered to help.\\xc2\\xa0Mr. Liew offered to invest $485,000 in Snapchat, which Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy accepted. The investment was completed in less than two weeks.\\xc2\\xa0What Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy paid less attention to were the exact terms that Mr. Liew embedded in the deal. Those terms gave Lightspeed the right of first refusal to invest in a future round of funding and the ability to increase its share of the company that round. Lightspeed could also take 50 percent of the future round.\\xc2\\xa0Such terms effectively let Lightspeed have veto power over the next investment at Snap.

But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal.

The job losses just in Texas, the most productive oil-producing state, totaled 98,000.\\xc2\\xa0Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople have left the industry, and they are not coming back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need someone to do that.

Few U.S. firms aside from Apple have made big profits on hardware, and camera and wearable gadget makers have much lower valuations than Snap is seeking.

We got evolutionary.\" Gene Munster, who covered Apple for more than a decade as a Piper Jaffray analyst and now runs Loup Ventures, echoes the criticism. \"Apple TV begs the question: Why does Apple do hobbies?\" he says. \"Either do it right or don\\'t do it at all.\"The Apple TV\\'s history is a study in gradualism. Previewed by Steve Jobs in 2006, the first box was designed simply to stream iTunes video from a Mac to a TV set. The next version, launched in the fall of 2010, let users stream content from the internet. The latest box was announced in September 2015, a few months later than originally scheduled. Widely considered an improvement by consumers and product reviewers, the Apple TV features the App Store, voice control and a glass remote that enables motion-controlled gaming, which for example lets players use the remote like a steering wheel for a car-racing title. \\xc2\\xa0But the latest Apple TV sells for $149, more than twice as much as its predecessor, $60 more than Amazon\\'s Fire TV and $20 more than the priciest Roku. What\\'s more, little about the viewing experience has changed. Apple TV users still have to buy an individual episode via the iTunes Store, pay extra for services like Hulu, or download an app tied to a particular channel and log in with an existing cable subscription. The Apple TV\\'s software is also less ambitious than originally envisioned. The current model features an iPhone-like app grid, but designers had prototyped more novel interfaces. One idea, dubbed \"Intentions\" internally, put the four tabs in the center of the screen: three for the Apple TV\\'s main content types (video, music, and gaming) and one for everything else. Another idea: letting viewers pull up previews of content by hovering on each icon (a feature currently reserved for apps in the top row).\\xc2\\xa0To a certain extent, the Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent\\'s addiction to fat margins.

Revenue from advertising fell from a year ago and a 4.0 percent year-on-year rise in users to 319 million fell short of Wall Street forecasts as well. Total revenue grew 1.0 percent to $717.2 million. The election of prolific tweeter Donald Trump as U.S. president failed to produce a \"Trump Bump\" in Twitter\\'s results, and Twitter declined to give guidance on future revenue with Chief Executive Jack Dorsey asking for patience. The microblogging service has struggled to find a formula that will attract a new crop of users or advertisers even as rivals have ridden a wave of rising investment in internet advertising. The lack of revenue growth has raised questions about Dorsey\\'s leadership and whether the company would be bought by a bigger media firm. Financial markets speculated about a sale of Twitter last year, but no concrete bids were forthcoming. Dorsey also faced concerns about his dual role as the chief executive of both Twitter and Square Inc. \"Running two companies is not the best idea,\" Steve Ballmer, a Twitter investor and a former Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) chief executive, told CNBC. Twitter was also hit by a string of executive departures in 2016, including in its products team, which had three heads in less than a year. In October, the company said it would cut 9.0 percent of its global workforce as part of a broader restructuring.

So, for example, if a search for a jacket brings up an image of someone wearing that jacket, Pinterest will also identify other products like the jeans and shoes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wearing. That means that if a business is trying to show off their products, users will have yet another way to jump to similar products they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re showing on Pinterest. All this is a result of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major investments in image search. Pinterest has largely built a name for itself because of its strong image search capabilities, and that thus far has been its selling point for advertisers. While companies like Google can capture the intent of a user directly searching for a product, Pinterest also taps into moments where potential customers are just meandering around and might stumble onto a product they may later buy. The act of saving that can also signal an intent to advertisers for a purchase, which is yet another touchpoint for those marketers to convert them into a sale.',\n",

       " b'Snap\\'s IPO to Be Haunted by Twitter and GoPro:\\xc2\\xa0Snap has gone to great lengths to distance itself from comparisons to Twitter Inc., the last big social media public offering. In its filing for an initial share sale, the maker of the Snapchat mobile app emphasized that it measures itself by daily active users -- a metric that Twitter doesn\\'t disclose. Snap explained that its users tell stories chronologically, unlike the Twitter timeline, which displays most recent posts first. The younger company also said it plans to focus on developed markets, instead of racing to find users all over the world. Snap calls itself a \"camera company,\" rather than focusing on its messaging app or media content.\\xc2\\xa0No matter the positioning, Snap\\'s numbers raise the same questions Twitter\\'s did. User growth is slowing and losses are mounting, but revenue gains are a bright spot. That\\'s how Twitter\\'s financial details looked when it filed to go public in 2013, and the investor concern has never subsided, even after a spate of executive departures made way for new management and initiatives to jump-start user growth. Twitter\\'s revenue started to slow when advertisers realized that with stagnant user growth, there wasn\\'t a reason to spend more. Snap is also trying to avoid one of Twitter\\'s IPO mistakes. Twitter compared itself in strategy to social media giant Facebook, but ultimately it paled in contrast to its rapidly growing\\xc2\\xa0rival,\\xc2\\xa0and has gotten punished by investors since then. Instead, Snap frames itself as a portfolio company, the owner of the Snapchat app, the Spectacles wearable video camera, and\\xc2\\xa0many\\xc2\\xa0more things to come. At the heart of\\xc2\\xa0it\\xc2\\xa0all is the idea of the camera -- because ``the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones.\\'\\' The word \"camera\" is mentioned 79 times in the IPO filing.\\xc2\\xa0That approach may bring another uncomfortable parallel. GoPro Inc., which makes small wearable\\xc2\\xa0action-video\\xc2\\xa0cameras beloved by extreme sports aficionados and outdoor enthusiasts, had its own highly anticipated public offering in 2014. It had a premise similar to Snap: capturing memories in the moment they happen, with the raw perspective of the user. As demand for its devices subsided, GoPro aimed instead to be a media company, seeking to generate more revenue from content that users created and selling advertising. That hasn\\'t worked out as planned. GoPro recently cut 200 jobs and its entire entertainment unit, and its shares now trade for less than half their IPO price. Other makers of wearable devices, including Fitbit,\\xc2\\xa0Jawbone\\xc2\\xa0and Pebble, haven\\'t fared much better.',\n",

However, many often don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t read the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfine print,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which can lead to them signing away more than they need to. So how can you avoid this increasingly common pitfall?One of the keys to making the right financing choice is understanding the concept of liquidation preferences. When lending money, banks or venture debt providers will require you to pledge certain assets as security\\xc2\\xa0against\\xc2\\xa0the funds advanced. This is known in the U.S. as\\xc2\\xa0a lien\\xc2\\xa0(or a charge in the U.K.). Liquidation preference determines which creditors are paid out first if your company ends up in financial difficulties and goes into receivership.The assets you pledge as security should be appropriate for how you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use the money you borrow. For example, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re borrowing money against your receivables to fund growth, you should only secure the loan against your receivables. Generally speaking, if an asset can be clearly defined, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no reason other assets should be included as security, although lenders will often try to include wider coverage as it improves their overall security position in the event of any default.\\xc2\\xa0Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an analogy: When you take out a mortgage to buy a home, you must pledge your home as security for the loan.

However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before.\\xc2\\xa0While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product.\\xc2\\xa0\"What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,\" said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost.Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015.\\xc2\\xa0Snap\\'s biggest losses stem from \"hosting fees\" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services.\\xc2\\xa0Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of\\xc2\\xa0these service\\xc2\\xa0is high. Still, the proportion of the company\\'s costs to its revenue has been declining.

That aligns with our report that multiple analytic providers and social media talent managers saw a big decline in Snapchat usage after Instagram Stories came out. While we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be sure Instagram Stories directly caused the issue, its rapid rise is highly correlated with Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slow down. The rise of international Snapchat Stories competitor Snow also could have contributed. Meanwhile, Snap says technical errors in the roll out of new products may have inhibited user growth at the end of Q3.\\xc2\\xa0In Q1 2016, Snapchat averaged 122 million daily active users, having grown 14 percent over the past quarter. Then Q2 proved to be its best growth quarter ever, thanks to massive interest in full-screen visual communication and a lack of direct competitors. Snapchat hit 143 million daily users with a whopping 17.2 percent growth rate.\\xc2\\xa0But on August 2nd, Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much larger competitor Instagram launched an exact clone of Snapchat Stories at the top of its app used by 300 million people daily and 500 million people each month. By October, the feature had 100 million daily users of its own.Suddenly, Snapchat slowed down. It had its lowest percentage growth quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data in 2014. Snapchat grew just 7 percent in Q3 2016 to reach 153 million daily users. And in Q4 it sank further, as Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily users, just shy of Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total number. Snapchat only pulled in an average daily user count of 158 million with a 3.2 percent growth rate in Q4.\\xc2\\xa0That means Snapchat was growing at just one-fifth of the speed it was\\xc2\\xa0two quarters\\xc2\\xa0earlier.',\n",

Driven by the desire to prove it was more than a fast follower of Apple, Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market ahead of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s iPhone 7. To fend off Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, it packed the phone with new features, like waterproof technology and iris-scanning for added security.\\xc2\\xa0But battery scientists, including those who spoke at the announcement, said aggressive decisions in designing the batteries made problems more likely. Pushing to make the battery thinner and more powerful, Samsung opted for an exceptionally thin separator in its battery. As the critical component that separates the positive and negative electrodes in a battery, separators can cause fires if they break down or contain flaws.\\xc2\\xa0UL, a safety science company contracted by Samsung to investigate the battery, said the thin separator offered poor protection against defects. It also said that the high energy density of the battery could increase the severity of failures when they occurred.\\xc2\\xa0Samsung\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insistence on speed and internal pressures to outdo rivals in part signal a breakdown in the ability to truly innovate and push out new ideas, critics say.

For those critics, these problems have come to light through another front: politics. Samsung has been caught up in a scandal surrounding the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president, which they say illustrates a hierarchical culture that tends to micromanage away creativity and insulate family-run business empires from accountability and competition.',\n",

The cars have been without a litany of safety features that are available in many older Tesla cars. The Autopilot software is being deployed to eligible Teslas over-the-air, and owners will not need to do anything special for the software to be downloaded. However, new Teslas still will not have all the Autopilot and semi-autonomous features that older Teslas have. And some cars, Musk says, will need to have their on-board cameras adjusted by Tesla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s service department for Autopilot to work correctly. Cars with Gen 2 Autopilot hardware will now have a speed-limited version of Autosteer, the feature that most owners consider to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutopilot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It will work at speeds below 45 mph, and is meant for use on highways with clear lane markings. It helps maintain position within the lane in slow-moving traffic. It works with the traffic-aware cruise control system (TACC), which is also rolling out with the update. TACC allows the vehicle adjust its speed based on the car ahead, decelerating or accelerating as needed. TACC is currently limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph. Previously, cars with second-generation Autopilot hardware only had basic cruise control. Vehicles are also gaining Forward Collision Warning (FCW), where the car will alert the driver when there is an object in your path and a collision is likely. The system will sound a chime and give a visual warning on the instrument panel.

It\\'s easy to forget when you find them strewn across the room, half-filled with leftover beer or crushed underfoot from parties the night before. But what many take for granted as simply a cheap, disposable beverage holder is the result of careful, beautiful engineering by people such as Robert Hulseman. While regular users may admire the Solo Cup\\'s lightness and balance, particularly when filled to the brim with libation, some of the most underappreciated aspects of the cup can be traced to a simple design aimed at solving a rather sticky problem. Before the invention of the Solo\\xc2\\xa0Cup\\xc2\\xa0as we know it, it was often difficult to remove one disposable cup from a whole stack because of the way they sometimes clung together, and designs aimed at eliminating the issue resulted in production irregularities that drove up costs and increased the likelihood of cup breakage. For a thing whose whole job is to hold other things, this outcome simply would not do. Enter the plastic Solo Cup, which won a patent in 1976. Described as \"an expendable thin walled cup for liquids and the like,\" the Solo Cup offered two key innovations that, according to the company, helped solve the sticking associated with large stacks of cups as well as the hard problem of cleanly removing the plastic cups from the production molds.One of the Solo Cup\\'s distinguishing features, according to the patent, was the curved lip of each cup (see 10a in Fig.3). When several cups were stacked together, the lips would \"engage\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to use the company\\'s language \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and rest upon each other, keeping one cup from sinking too tightly into the next. But, Solo Cup Co. observed, this helped create another problem. When cups like these were subjected to crushing forces from various angles, the bottoms could warp in ways that actually made it harder to separate the cups. So the bottoms had to be reinforced (see Fig. 4, Fig. 6 and 26-28 in Fig. 3). This is how the plastic Solo Cup gained indentations or divots in the base that made the bottoms more rigid and allowed for more air flow between each stacked cup, which allegedly had the side benefit of helping the cups come apart.',\n",

A decade ago, when viral phenomena were still opaque and full of mystery, we gazed awe-struck as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharlie Bit My Finger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rose to fame. Jukin, since then, has systematized the riddle by acquiring clips that meet viral criteria and serving them to YouTube channels and other media outlets that might help induce a spread. The process I was watching was the same one that delivered us Pizza Rat, the video of a rodent dragging a slice down the subway stairs that went viral in 2015. Jukin researchers also discovered Peanut Butter Baby (a toddler covered head to toe in peanut butter) and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChristopher Columbus of Brooklyn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (a white guy yelling at another white person about gentrification). If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen a funny clip on a late-night show, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Morning America,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or the 11-o\\xe2\\x80\\x99-clock news, there are pretty good odds Jukin dug it up. In order to meet this demand for fresh content \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a demand created by the process that supplies it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jukin scales idle browsing to industrial proportions. A researcher, on average, watches 200 clips daily. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a thousand videos each week, or 50,000 per year, give or take. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research is aided by proprietary software called Riff, which generates feeds based on niche viral keywords. Maybe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen 15 or 20 good videos of babies tasting lemons for the first time, or troops surprising mothers at Christmas, or dogs and parakeets becoming unlikely friends. A Jukin researcher has seen these, too, plus all the duds that never made it to your feed. Of those 200 reviewed on a typical day, perhaps three or four may be good enough to license, generally for a fee between $50 and $5,000, and often a revenue split.

       " b'WTF is a liquidation preference? Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk through the basics.\\xc2\\xa0Broadly, a liquidation preference determines who gets what when a company is liquidated. This can mean when a company is merged, when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sold, when there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a change of control of the company or when there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wind-down.\\xc2\\xa0In all of these scenarios, a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liquidator looks at the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secured and unsecured loan agreements, along with who owns preferred versus common stock. (Preferred shares are what VCs typically buy to ensure that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re repaid ahead of holders of common shares.) Everyone on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cap table is ranked after that, and the liquidator distributes the proceeds of a sale accordingly. Consider the wind-down scenario. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say a company raised both venture capital and venture debt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a loan. Say that as time went on, it began falling behind on its debt payments, and that its VCs decided it was a losing proposition to continue funding the company. If there was any capital remaining \\xe2\\x80\\x94 say the company hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burned through every last bit of its funding, or say some money was made from a sell-off of its remaining assets, like its intellectual property \\xe2\\x80\\x94 its investors would be paid before anyone at the company saw a nickel.\\xc2\\xa0When the outcome is much better, the same thing basically happens \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though who gets how much and when grows more complicated with every new round of funding a company raises. The reason: When investors make a liquidation preference a condition for investing in a startup, they do it in order to claim their part of the profits first. But later-stage investors can demand liquidation preferences that ensure they get paid before earlier investors, too. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of like a layer cake. They can also demand that they get paid back more than the standard of one times their money back.\\xc2\\xa0Why would startups agree to these seemingly onerous terms? Well, sometimes, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any choice. They take the terms, or they go out of business. Sometimes, startups wanting unicorn status will agree to the terms for a richer valuation, thinking it will attract press, customers and employees. Whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth the gamble takes time to play out. But certainly, things can get ugly when these same companies get sold rather than go public (a process that converts everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares to common shares). It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uglier still when they sell for less than expected, the investors take their cut, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little to nothing left for founders and employees.\\xc2\\xa0Not every deal involves liquidation preferences. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t typically see them in early-stage deals. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem them in deals where a company has been created by a founder whom VCs trip over themselves to fund. But they do start to appear as a company matures. (For some context, in recent quarters, senior liquidation preferences have been showing up in between 25 and 35 percent of deals, according to the law firm Fenwick & West, which studies these things.)',\n",

On Wednesday, it released a report laying out its approach to local regulations, trying to\\xc2\\xa0capitalize\\xc2\\xa0on a weeklong stretch in which it agreed to enforce limits on rentals in London and Amsterdam, dropped a lawsuit against New York City, and praised new rules in New Orleans as a potential nationwide model.\\xc2\\xa0The report released today mostly restates the arguments that Airbnb has made in the past. Airbnb acknowledges that rules will vary from city to city. In general, it says it wants to collect\\xc2\\xa0taxes,\\xc2\\xa0and will help cities enforce limits on how many nights per year people can rent out their homes on the platform. It continues to push back against the idea that hosts should have to register their apartment with city\\xc2\\xa0officials,\\xc2\\xa0but suggests ways that cities can make the process less onerous.\\xc2\\xa0The moves over the last week mark a shift in Airbnb's priorities, putting a stable regulatory landscape ahead of the move-fast-and-break-things approach that got it to this point. It's also a major de-escalation for a company that spent the last several months suing governments in some of its most important markets.

And while there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a dramatic pop, it continued to climb and closed the day at $30.10 per share.\\xc2\\xa0That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good start, particularly considering that adtech companies have struggled recently on the public markets, which has made venture capitalists wary of the industry, as well.\\xc2\\xa0Ventura, Calif.-headquartered The Trade Desk, which offers tools for ad buyers, was probably helped by its financials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the company is profitable, with 2015 revenue more than doubling year-over-year, to $113.8 million.Chief Client Officer Brian Stempeck also argued that The Trade Desk stands out because it has built real self-serve technology: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of our people are engineers, building products, and when someone works in client services, they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t managing ad campaigns \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re teaching others how to run the software.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Looking ahead, Stempeck said The Trade Desk will continue to expand internationally while also building more products for programmatic buying of TV ads.

Users will be able to book a restaurant through the assistant and buy tickets to a game or event. Anything that involves getting things done more easily will be addressed over time, Fox said. Google has nothing planned on the advertising side yet, he added.Google didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give the system a name -- a contrast to Siri, Alexa and Cortana. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in part because Google designed its assistant to learn and evolve to be a different helper depending on the user. You can say, \"My favorite sports team is the San Francisco Giants,\" and it will reply, \"OK I will remember that.\" Later, when you ask, \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the latest score for my team?\" it will send the score of the latest Giants baseball game, Fox said. Google is aware of the limits of its AI and is trying not to promise too much from the Assistant, at least early on. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t automatically insert information into chats between friends on Allo, but will occasionally appear to say it has suggestions and wait to be summoned. It will also stay away from value judgments or sensitive subjects such as violent and adult material. In those cases, it will apologize and say it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer, or send web results from Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s search engine.Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Assistant already knows its rivals.

This may seem like a trivial question, but it is one that cuts to the heart of whether humans are fundamentally rational \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in this case, whether they earn their incomes efficiently \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as the discipline has traditionally assumed.\\xc2\\xa0In one camp is a group of so-called behavioral economists who have found evidence that many taxi drivers work longer hours on days when business is slow and shorter hours when business is brisk \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the opposite of what economic rationality, to say nothing of common sense, would seem to dictate.\\xc2\\xa0So who is right? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where Uber comes in. When one of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s researchers, using its supremely detailed data on drivers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 work time and rides, waded into the debate with a paper this year, the results were intriguing.\\xc2\\xa0Over all, there was little evidence that drivers were driving less when they could make more per hour than usual. But that was not true for a large portion of new drivers. Many of these drivers appeared to have an income goal in mind and stopped when they were near it, causing them to knock off sooner when their hourly wage was high and to work longer when their wage was low.Whatever the case, the result seems to have one very obvious implication: Anyone trying to make it in the gig economy should probably pick a favorite platform or two and stick with them rather than constantly jump around from one type of gig to another.',\n",

An additional 17 percent went to set-top boxes, such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Of these, Roku boxes were the overwhelming favorite among Olympics viewers, eating up a 10 percent share. In the end, however, PCs took the prize, accounting for more than 60 percent of consumption. \\xc2\\xa0Why is this so interesting? Well, much of the narrative surrounding entertainment and technology these days has to do with mobile devices becoming a more dominant platform. Sandvine's data show that iPhones, Android devices and iPads account for almost one-third of general Internet consumption, much higher than what we see from the chart above.\\xc2\\xa0Analysts say this discrepancy highlights the particular way in which Americans could access their Olympics coverage online. To watch the Internet live stream, viewers needed to log in through their cable subscription. The downside to this meant being chained to a cable provider, but the upside was that once you authenticated you could watch from any device \\xe2\\x80\\x94 mobile or otherwise. Although much of our media consumption is increasingly shifting toward mobile devices, live-stream events such as the Olympics may be one area where PCs could remain dominant for some time.\",\n",

While Damodaran thinks Uber and riding sharing will continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, he\\'s concerned about whether revenues will follow. China especially worries him given Uber\\'s recent sale of its operations in that country to Didi Chuxing, its biggest rival there. The decision to exit \"even if it was the right one from the perspective of saving itself from a cash war, will reduce its potential revenues in the future.\" \\xc2\\xa0In the other places where Uber does continue to operate, there are often large discounts for riders and other special promotions. This is proof that the business model is challenged, according to Damodaran. \"I believe that a significant portion of their expenses are associating with maintaining revenues rather than growing them,\" he says. \"In effect, it looks like the business model that has brought these companies as far as they have in such a short time period are flawed, because what allowed these companies to grow incredibly fast is getting in the way of converting revenues to profits, since there are no moats to defend.\" Damodaran says that young companies all face a point in time that he calls the \"Bar Mitzvah Moment,\" when the focus shifts from growth to evidence that the business model can be profitable. In his mind, that moment is right now for ride sharing. \"After an initial life, where investors have been easily sated with reports of more ride sharing usage (number of cities served, rides, drivers etc.), these investors are starting to ask the tough questions about how ride sharing companies propose turning these impressive usage statistics into profits.\"',\n",

Didi and Uber have raised and spent billions of dollars in a discount slugfest to win drivers, passengers and market share in China.\\xc2\\xa0Didi, now worth around $35 billion, last year invested about $30 million in Ola, which is also backed by Japan\\'s SoftBank Group, and the two are allies in an anti-Uber group that also includes U.S.-based Lyft and Southeast Asia-focused Grab.\\xc2\\xa0\"This (Didi/Uber China) deal changes the dynamics of how they (Didi) will invest in India,\" said the person, who didn\\'t want to be named because the discussions were private. If Didi invests more in Ola, it\\'s effectively betting against Uber, its new partner in China, the person said.\\xc2\\xa0It\\'s not clear whether Didi would provide equity or debt to Ola, which has raised around $1.3 billion in funding and is valued at over $5 billion. SoftBank Capital, Ola\\'s key investor, faces its own financial issues and is selling assets to raise cash and reduce debt, which may pose another fundraising challenge for Ola, which was aiming to raise another $1 billion this year.After the Didi deal, Uber is even more focused on India, which it has previously called its No. 2 priority overseas market, doubling down on resources, staffing and technology deployed there, said two people familiar with Uber\\'s plans, one of whom is based in the United States.',\n",

The additional capital would only move Airbnb from the fifth to the forth most valuable tech unicorn at a potential valuation of $30 billion (tear). \\xc2\\xa0Even as a late-stage company, Airbnb has to be increasingly conscious of the capital it takes on. Too much equity dilutes early investors, while too much debt could put investors at risk if valuations were to suddenly tank. Debt as an asset class is paid off before equity.\\xc2\\xa0Airbnb has notoriously taken actions to strategically prolong an IPO, bringing on a $1 billion credit faculty last year to support growth without diluting investors.\\xc2\\xa0The company previously had an approximate valuation of $27 billion, so while the round is large, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deviate from prior anti-dilution strategies.

Most of all, brands wondered how Snapchat could be effective when the ads \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like Snapchat messages \\xe2\\x80\\x94 disappeared.\\xc2\\xa0In the last 15 months, Snapchat has moved to respond. It introduced new ad formats.

Most important, Snapchat has persuaded brands like Tiffany & Company, Kraft Foods and Burger King that its ads let them interact playfully with this young audience.Now Snapchat faces the challenge of keeping up its nascent ad business as its early success raises the competitive hackles of rivals. On Tuesday, Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, introduced a near carbon copy of a Snapchat photo and video service known as Stories.\\xc2\\xa0A lot is riding on Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s building up its ad business. The company, which Mr. Spiegel helped found in 2011 and is now based in the Venice Beach neighborhood of Los Angeles, needs to justify a valuation of about $19 billion that its investors have placed on it. The company also faces sky-high revenue expectations; the investment bank Jefferies recently projected that Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue would grow to $1 billion next year from more than $350 million this year.Mr. Khan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest job was to explain why Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unusual platform was better for advertisers. The task was thorny because Snapchat is a messaging, sharing and broadcast service where most content disappears.

The giant retailer may not let it happen again. Walmart is in talks to acquire Jet.com, Lore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new startup that has raised more than $800 million in financing in an attempt to build a new online megastore, according to a person familiar with the talks. It is not clear how far along they are. News of the talks was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the tie-up could value Jet at as much as $3 billion. A Walmart spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A Jet spokesman declined to comment. A $3 billion price tag would be a steep one for Walmart, considering that Jet is largely still unproven and burning more than $20 million a month on advertising alone. A deal would also certainly not be what Lore had in mind when he set out to build a legitimate competitor to Amazon, Walmart and others after his non-compete agreement with the Seattle-based retailer expired two years ago. But it would be a marriage of necessity for both sides, and one that probably makes too much sense not to happen. On the Walmart side, its e-commerce efforts have largely been viewed as a failure in recent years for a retailer of its size and power. Annual revenue for the division is around $14 billion, compared to $99 billion for Amazon, excluding Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s AWS cloud computing unit.Five years ago, it would have seemed possible, but unlikely, that Walmart could catch up with Amazon. Today, that notion is laughable.For Lore and Jet, the deal would be something of a shocker. Lore pocketed dozens of millions of dollars when he sold Diapers.com to Amazon so he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly need the money. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons his backers believed him when he said his goal was to build a company worth tens of billions. But the hurdles to get there have been significant from the start and perhaps even larger than Lore imagined. Jet only really works long-term as a standalone company if it can convince millions of people to order multiple items at a time to earn discounts; individual product prices aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t typically better than its competitors.',\n",

The purchase this week of Uber China by Didi Chuxing after a protracted competition shows that at least domestically, Chinese players can take on the most sophisticated and largest start-ups coming out of America.Industry leaders point to a number of areas where China jumped first. Before the online dating app Tinder, people in China used an app called Momo to flirt with nearby singles. Before the Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos discussed using drones to deliver products, Chinese media reported that a local delivery company, S.F. Express, was experimenting with the idea. WeChat offered speedier in-app news articles long before Facebook, developed a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made major use of QR codes well before Snapchat.\\xc2\\xa0Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.',\n",

A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.\\xc2\\xa0The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.Under the terms of the deal, the new company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $28 billion valuation and Uber China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public.

That battle, waged through massive subsidies on rides, wound up costing Uber $2 billion, the people said. Alarmed, its investors clamored for a ceasefire.In the end, Didi proved too resourceful -- and too well-connected -- for the ride-sharing giant to dethrone. Uber threw in the towel just days after China banned the practice of charging less than the cost of a ride, depriving the U.S. company of a tried-and-true engagement tactic. In a blogpost obtained by Bloomberg before an official announcement, Kalanick portrayed the deal as a merger that strengthens both parties; others, including Grab CEO Anthony Tan, saw it as a humbled Uber taking its ball elsewhere.But Didi proved more creative, and local connections came through. The conflict took an unusual turn as third parties began to get drawn into the mix. In August, Uber complained it had been blocked from WeChat, the popular messaging service run by Didi-backer Tencent. Then Didi recruited allies, forging a four-way alliance with ride-sharing services that compete with Uber, including Lyft Inc. in the U.S., Grab and India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ola.\\xc2\\xa0Didi gained confidence as it entered the new year. From President Jean Liu on down, its executives were determined to deal a knockout blow. Didi began raising more money and its emboldened executives openly declared victory.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will be the last one standing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy, said in what proved to be a prescient April address.Recent funding saw Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s valuation swell to $68 billion and the company said it had access to more than $11 billion on its balance sheet. Didi, said to be valued at close to $28 billion, had more than $10 billion at its disposal.\\xc2\\xa0In the end, Didi proved too large an opponent, with backers including some of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest government institutions and even Apple Inc. The four-year-old company now handles more than 11 million rides a day and serves about 300 million users across some 400 cities, offering taxis, private cars, ride sharing and test driving.',\n",

But now that Didi has acquired Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s China operations, that partnership has been thrown into doubt. In addition to a $1 billion investment Didi is making into Uber, the deal also brings Uber CEO Travis Kalanick onto Didi Chuxing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s board and Didi Chairman Cheng Wei onto Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s board. Both Kalanick and Wei are non-voting members of the board. That means, as of last night, Didi Chuxing is more invested in Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success than it is in the alliance. Didi, so far, had invested about $100 million in Lyft, $350 million in Grab and $30 million in Ola, altogether about $480 million, less than half of what it just invested in Uber.',\n",

Investors opened their wallets for the iPhone maker, allowing the company to lower yields on all portions of the offering, which was funding shareholder buybacks.\\xc2\\xa0Like Apple, Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt issuance is tied to avoiding an increase in its tax bill. Companies with cash holdings from overseas profits have to pay a 35 percent tax to repatriate those funds to the U.S. Rather than use that cash to fund its acquisition and pay the hefty taxes that result, it is far cheaper for large multinationals like Microsoft to borrow the funds.',\n",

Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.\\xc2\\xa0A big part of what has made Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P.

That deal, a hostile takeover fought out over 18 months, extended Oracle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customer base and product offerings.\\xc2\\xa0It made Oracle bigger, but it did not change its business model. About 5,000 PeopleSoft employees, close to half the company, were laid off in the following months.\\xc2\\xa0The NetSuite purchase, on the other hand, is at the heart of Oracle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fight to remake itself for the modern world of cloud computing, or providing accessing to vast computational resources over the internet. This transition has shaken up the software business for the last several years. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created markets worth billions, and older companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have struggled to change the way they make and sell their products.The deal also illustrates that, for all the reach and novelty of tech, Silicon Valley remains a very small place with long personal histories. Mr. Goldberg got the idea for NetSuite after conversations with Mr. Ellison about where else the internet might go. Down the hall was another rising star at Oracle, named Marc Benioff.\\xc2\\xa0Mr. Benioff started a company called Salesforce.com within weeks of NetSuite\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start, also with backing from Mr. Ellison. Today, Salesforce is regarded as the leading company selling only cloud software, with a market capitalization of $55.7 billion.\\xc2\\xa0The relationship between Oracle and Salesforce is testy, however.

Every other company should be afraid, very afraid. The deal anecdotally shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change. The very nature of a company is fundamentally changing, becoming smaller and leaner with far fewer employees. Dollar Shave Club was a phenom in the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grooming industry. The online business was founded in 2011 by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin to combat the high cost of razors. The idea was rather simple. Instead of paying $10 or $20 a month at a store for disposable razors, a Dollar Shave Club subscriber could go online and set up a regular order to be shipped to his home monthly at a fraction of the retail cost. The experiment was a brave one. Until that time, Gillette dominated the razor business and was in an arms race with itself to add yet more blades and other features to its razors. Gillette was so dominant in advertising and shelf space that Procter & Gamble paid $57 billion for the company in 2005. Everything changed in 2012, when Mr. Dubin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comedic free ad posted on YouTube. Within 24 hours, the new business had more than 12,000 orders, more than it could handle. The ad went on to get over 20 million views and rocket Dollar Shave Club to over $240 million in revenue. The wealth will be spread among a few. Dollar Shave Club has over three million subscribers but only about 190 employees. Its razors were made in South Korea by Dorco. Distribution was initially handled in-house but eventually was contracted to a third-party company in Kentucky. What remained was a terrific design, marketing and customer service shop; and a business that was easily expandable to meet demand and that had a good niche with men who do not like to shop. These super-successful companies with few employees should worry an America struggling with inequality.\\xc2\\xa0That is the way things roll these days. It used to be that if you wanted to sell razors, you needed a factory, a distribution center, a sales force, a research and development team and a marketing budget. Keeping all of these functions under one roof lowered transaction costs and made operations more efficient. In part this was because of communication structures \\xe2\\x80\\x94 having telephone and mail together was a necessity.\\xc2\\xa0But the internet, mass transportation and globalization destroy everything. If you do not believe this change is about brand, experience and disruption, know that you can buy razors directly from Dorco, presumably the same brands sold by Dollar Shave Club.',\n",

Swedish investment firm Kinnevik also owns a large stake in Jabong's parent Global Fashion Group. While Jabong has managed to reduce losses by reducing discounts, both Kinnevik and Rocket Internet seem unwilling to infuse fresh capital and are believed to be keen to exit.\",\n",

The tests, which are an important sign of confidence in Britain after its historic vote last month to leave the European Union, are to begin immediately.The move puts pressure on the F.A.A., which had recently rebuffed requests by Amazon, Google and other drone makers to advance their delivery plans. The tech behemoths and other drone makers have aggressively lobbied the F.A.A. to authorize the devices to significantly reduce costs to transport goods by airplane, freight and trucks.\\xc2\\xa0Amazon said it hoped success with the drone trials in Britain would encourage more hesitant regulators in the United States and elsewhere to loosen restrictions. The trials will \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelp identify what operating rules and safety regulations will be needed to help move the drone industry forward,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company said in a statement.\\xc2\\xa0Amazon will work with British regulators to test drones that fly beyond the line of sight of operators in rural and suburban areas. It will also test whether a single operator can safely command multiple drones at once, as well as technology that lets the machines automatically detect and avoid other planes, buildings and people.',\n",

Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.\\xc2\\xa0But Yahoo, despite constant management turmoil, kept growing. Started as a directory of websites, the company was soon doing much more, offering searches, email, shopping and news. Those services, which were free to consumers, were supported by advertising displayed on its various pages.\\xc2\\xa0For a long time, the model worked. It seemed like every company in America \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and across much of the world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured in to Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival was a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing.

Cloud systems are cheap and flexible, and companies are quickly shifting their technologies for that environment. According to analysts at Gartner, the global cloud-computing business will be worth $67 billion by 2020, compared with $23 billion at the end of this year.For Google, a loss in cloud computing would be a rare misstep for a company that revolutionized media with its advertising business, and then made the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading smartphone operating system.But it will be an uphill climb.\\xc2\\xa0Amazon Web Services, which began its cloud product a decade ago, remains the leader. The company took in $2.6 billion, 9 percent of Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales, in the first quarter of 2016. Profits from the service made up 56 percent of Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating income. Those numbers may well be higher when Amazon reports its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\\xc2\\xa0Microsoft styled itself a cloud company, too, and the company said last week that revenue from Azure, its cloud business, which was founded in 2010, rose 100 percent over the last year. Cloud technology also figures in crucial businesses like Office 365.\\xc2\\xa0In contrast, Google Cloud Platform does not even figure in the earnings reports of Alphabet, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parent company. That has to sting, since the company owns perhaps the largest network of computers on the planet, spending close to $10 billion a year to handle services like search, Gmail and YouTube.the company said it has used artificial intelligence to cut the power use in its data centers 15 percent, a huge decrease considering how efficient these data factories were already.\\xc2\\xa0Power is probably the largest single cost for all three of the cloud companies. Google is almost certain to use its savings to reduce prices, much the way it won in search advertising by figuring out its competitors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 costs, then undercutting them.\\xc2\\xa0That ability to find energy efficiency may be a powerful tool to sell to others over Google Compute.',\n",

Ailes is known as a venal operator, specializing in deals with questionable reciprocity.

In the world of cable news, marketers really only pay for viewers in the 25-54 age range.

Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.\\xc2\\xa0Without the deferral, Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion.\\xc2\\xa0The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.',\n",

Its 2015 revenue was nearly one billion British pounds.\\xc2\\xa0And its sphere of influence is growing, both in terms of the number of chips using its design as well as the kinds of products.

The game is heavy on fun but light on explanations -- particularly if you're so excited to start playing that you blitz through the opening tutorial.\\xc2\\xa0So maybe you've downloaded it, fired it up and then gotten, well, completely lost. If you're completely mystified by how this game actually works, here are some basics to get you out there and catching Pokemon in no time.Once you download the app, you'll be asked to sign in. You can sign in using an existing Google account. Or, if you're not so keen to connect your Pokemon identity to your Google identity, then you can also sign up with the Pokemon Trainer Club, which is an account with the Pokemon Co. From there, you design your character and pick your first Pokemon. Then you can get going!\\xc2\\xa0And you will have to actually get going. The whole selling point of the game is to walk around the real world to find the cute little critters. This not only encourages you to explore your own city, but also -- gasp! -- gets you outside and around other people. In fact, this is not really a game you can play while stationary. Sometimes Pokemon will come to you, but more often than not you have to go to them.\",\n",

That is, when you walk around the streets of whatever city or town you live in, your avatar moves inside the game.

Today, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a highly successful company in its own right, riding a remarkable $10 billion run rate. What you may not know is that the roots for the idea of AWS go back to the 2000 timeframe when Amazon was a far different company than it is today \\xe2\\x80\\x94 simply an e-commerce company struggling with scale problems. Those issues forced the company to build some solid internal systems to deal with the hyper growth it was experiencing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that laid the foundation for what would become AWS.\\xc2\\xa0Speaking recently at an event in Washington, DC, AWS CEO Andy Jassy, who has been there from the beginning, explained how these core systems developed out of need over a three-year period beginning in 2000, and, before they knew it, without any real planning, they had the makings of a business that would become AWS. It began way back in the 2000 timeframe when the company wanted to launch an e-commerce service called Merchant.com to help third-party merchants like Target or Marks & Spencer build online shopping sites on top of Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s e-commerce engine. It turned out to be a lot harder than they thought to build an external development platform, because, like many startups, when it launched in 1994, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really plan well for future requirements. Instead of an organized development environment, they had unknowingly created a jumbled mess. That made it a huge challenge to separate the various services to make a centralized development platform that would be useful for third parties.At that point, the company took its first step toward building the AWS business by untangling that mess into a set of well-documented APIs. While it drove the smoother development of Merchant.com, it also served the internal developer audience well, too, and it set the stage for a much more organized and disciplined way of developing tools internally going forward.',\n",

Since all those regulatory issues came to light, the company has laid off more than 350 employees and parted ways with its former CEO Parker Conrad. The biggest issue stemmed from a program called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Macro\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that would aid in circumventing state licensing requirements.All this is basically a way to reset expectations for investors, as well as try to retain employees following the changes in the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership structure.

The company, which licenses chip technology and designs, gets more than a third of its sales from the U.S., 19 percent from China and another 25 percent from Taiwan and South Korea.

The hope, for many startups, is that Twilio will re-open the tech IPO window with a strong showing after trading begins tomorrow. If that happens, it might convince investors that many startups that have hit frothy valuations have come back in line with reality, and these companies could be good investment targets if they choose to go public. Twilio is not profitable, with the company reporting a net loss of $35.5 million on $166.9 million in revenue last year. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s showing strong revenue growth, with the company bringing in $88.8 million in revenue from 2014.\\xc2\\xa0In total, Twilio has raised more than $200 million in venture financing, with Bessemer Venture Partners owning the largest chunk of the company at 28.5 percent per its last IPO filing.

Now it may add something new to the list: the leveraged loan market.\\xc2\\xa0The ride-hailing start-up is looking to issue as much as $2 billion in securities to investors, said a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.By tapping leveraged loans, Uber is adding to its trove of billions made up of many types of securities, which the company has been spending as it expands worldwide. Uber has raised equity from traditional venture capital sources, strategic corporate investors and private equity. This month, the company said that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Public Investment Fund. Uber has also raised billions in convertible debt, which can be exchanged for equity at a future date.\\xc2\\xa0Uber has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash or debt at a rapid pace of once every few months. The company needs financing as it now operates in at least 69 countries and is fighting an expensive battle in China against a rival, Didi Chuxing, which is also raising money to expand.\\xc2\\xa0Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued to a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley.\\xc2\\xa0Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s valuation of $62.5 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would not change with this new investment.\\xc2\\xa0Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing.',\n",

The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally.\\xc2\\xa0The deal is Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey know the interconnections of the business world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.\\xc2\\xa0The rapid devaluation has posed more than just a problem for investors. LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employees are paid largely in stock, and therein lies the rub: Around the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new 26-story skyscraper that opened in downtown San Francisco in March, as well as the corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., there have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes.Mr. Weiner \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who took over as LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.\\xc2\\xa0You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news releases. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.',\n",

The idea of a bunch of retailers collaborating effectively on a joint venture seemed far-fetched, let alone one where technology would play a critical role.\\xc2\\xa0Then there was the motivation for the venture, which seemed shortsighted: Get customers to pay with anything but traditional credit cards, since they cost Walmart and other retailers higher transaction fees than other forms of payment.\\xc2\\xa0There were plenty of other signs along the way spelling out trouble. Just a sampling: Customers who signed up for the app had their email addresses leaked in a hack in 2014, and the new CEO who arrived in 2015 said the launch likely wouldn't happen until 2016.\\xc2\\xa0In the meantime, some big MCX partners like Best Buy said they would start accepting Apple Pay.

Mr. de Langhe noticed that the seat rated lowest by Consumer Reports got a high rating on Amazon, and the one rated highest by Consumer Reports received a low rating on Amazon.\\xc2\\xa0The more popular seat on Amazon was also more expensive. Were reviewers, he wondered, paying more attention to things like price and brand than the objective, measurable ability of the seat to protect its occupant?

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States along with state-backed investors in Singapore and China have ploughed money into hot tech investments such as ride-sharing company Uber \\xc2\\xa0and Chinese Internet giant Alibaba and its private affiliates. With overall funding for start-ups slowing down by a third to $25.5 billion in the last two quarters, according to data from CB Insights, high-profile ventures are turning to government funds or institutional money to create \"private IPOs\" rather than to venture capitalists or chancing public listings. These capital injections have helped to keep valuations high as other tech ventures such as those of cloud storage service Dropbox or Indian takeaway food ordering app Zomato have been marked down by some earlier backers. Saudi Arabia\\'s Public Investment Fund said last week it invested $3.5 billion in Uber, Silicon Valley\\'s most highly valued private company. At $62.5 billion, the car-sharing firm is worth more than the stock market capitalizations of automakers BMW or GM and close to VW, Daimler and Ford.\\xc2\\xa0Also last week, Singapore\\'s two big government investors bought $1 billion of Alibaba Group shares, while in April, China Investment Corp, took part in a $4.5 billion round in Alibaba\\'s financial services affiliate ANT Financial with other investors, marking the largest ever funding round in a fintech firm.

       " b\"The incredibly brilliant way people are now paying for things in Asia:\\xc2\\xa0When Apple first rolled out Apple Pay in 2014, it was billed as a simpler way to buy goods and services. You take your phone out, tap it to the credit card reader, and off you go. Seems convenient, right? \\xc2\\xa0But some consumers in Asia think there's an even better way to pay.\\xc2\\xa0In recent years, millions of people have grown accustomed to using messaging apps to communicate. Some of these apps now support person-to-person digital cash transfers. So the next step is pretty logical: Asian retailers have begun using these same messaging platforms to sell everything from clothing to hamburgers to train tickets. And as a consumer, you never have to leave the app to pay.\\xc2\\xa0On the surface, this alternative sounds a lot like Apple Pay (or Samsung Pay, or Android Pay, etc.). But conducting real-life and online transactions through messaging apps stands to change retail like none of these other services have. What we're seeing in Asia is the rise of mobile payments that run primarily on software, not hardware as we've tried to implement here in the United States. And that simple distinction may be the key to everything from accelerating the spread of mobile payments to unlocking deep, digital interactions with customers in brick-and-mortar stores to democratizing e-commerce away from giant online businesses like Amazon.To buy a meal with WeChat, which in China goes by the name Weixin, customers simply pull up a QR code in the app that's connected to their credit card or other financial account. Once the cashier scans the code, that's it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no further action is needed. Retailers in China will typically offerdiscounts to WeChat users as an incentive to pay with the app.\",\n",

Uber has no need for such traditions.\\xc2\\xa0The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2009 and valued at $62.5 billion, has now raised $11 billion as it spends heavily to expand globally and battle well-funded rivals such as Lyft Inc. and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Didi.\\xc2\\xa0The ride-hailing company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest infusion of cash -- a record $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sovereign wealth fund -- means Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has the finances to continue avoiding a listing of his company any time soon. \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make sure it happens as late as possible,\" he told CNBC earlier this year. The money from Saudi Arabia is a new wrinkle in the shifting way the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest technology startups are being funded. The $3.5 billion raised by Uber Technologies Inc. this week is far larger than what most companies are able raise when they hold public offerings: Twitter Inc. netted $1.82 billion during its 2013 IPO and First Data Corp. raised $2.56 billion in the largest technology IPO of the past 12 months.

The investment does not cash out any of Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing investors.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.\\xc2\\xa0The investment from Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest single investments collected by the technology world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top privately held companies. Uber, whose valuation makes it Silicon Valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most valuable private business, has collected billions at a rapid clip over the last three years.\\xc2\\xa0Uber has drawn from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds like that of Qatar have also invested. Other smaller tech companies have not fared as well in raising money over the last several months. Some so-called unicorns, the term used to refer to businesses valued at more than $1 billion, have struggled to collect new investments, and some, like Jawbone, have had to raise money at lower valuations.\\xc2\\xa0Uber is racing to defend its territory \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 against incumbents in other regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country. Both companies have made no indications that they will back down.\\xc2\\xa0Though Uber dominates the American market for ride-hailing, it has increasingly seen overseas markets as crucial to its growth.\\xc2\\xa0Among Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increasingly important overseas markets is the Middle East, where the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million.

In their haste to get financing, start-up founders often fail to read the fine print and later discover that they have signed away huge shares of the profits. In some cases, founders may be removed by the board of their own companies by the time the businesses are rapidly growing or plan to go public. For these reasons, some founders opt to take debt capital from banks and investors instead of giving away equity.',\n",

Those sobering insights were among the hundreds packed into the much-awaited Internet Trends report, an annual tech industry ritual led by Mary Meeker, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Developing countries have proven harder to capture than expected because internet access remains inaccessible or unaffordable for many, the report said. Here are some other highlights from the report: India is the one country where internet usage is growing, up 40 percent compared with 33 percent a year ago. India passed the U.S. to become the No. 2 global market behind China in 2015. The Asia Pacific region represented 52 percent of smartphone users globally in 2015. The rapid growth in recent years has begun to slow, dropping to 23 percent in 2015 from 35 percent in 2014.\\xc2\\xa0North America, Europe, and Japan represented 63 percent of global GDP in 1985. By 2015, their contribution dropped to 29 percent. China and emerging markets in Asia represented 63 percent of global GDP last year. Online advertising is still not very effective. Advertisers are spending an outsize amount on legacy media. Global birth rates are down 39 percent since 1960. So where will technology growth come from?

To help them get started, Uber has been offering short-term leases since July through a wholly owned Delaware-based subsidiary called Xchange Leasing, LLC. It partners with auto dealerships, advertises to drivers, manages risk, and even pays repo men to chase down cars whose drivers aren't making their payments.

The biggest partner app Stripe launched with was Twitter, whose 'Buy' buttons allowed users to buy items directly from a tweet. But just a month later, Twitter disbanded the team working on 'Buy' buttons, as Recode reported on Thursday, and shifted its focus on commerce to other initiatives. The 'Buy' button technology still exists, and retailers can still use Stripe's new product, Relay, to sell products on Twitter. But the perception that Stripe's biggest partner no longer considers it a priority doesn't look good. You could imagine the challenge convincing potential retail partners that they should invest in a program whose biggest platform partner no longer appears to be interested. The idea behind Relay is that people will increasingly want to purchase items online wherever they discover them, even if it's not on a shopping site or app. And as people spend more of their online time on Twitter and other social apps, they should have the option to complete transactions quickly without leaving those apps, the thinking goes, rather than getting redirected to another site that may be difficult to navigate on a mobile phone. In addition to Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook have also bought into this thinking to some degree. Each has introduced 'Buy' buttons, with varying levels of investment. But neither one of them currently works with Stripe on the Relay product. The open question for Stripe is whether retailers and users will show real interest in Twitter's Buy buttons without the company promoting them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, if not, whether Stripe can find another big-name app to replace Twitter as the anchor partner.\",\n",

The Japanese conglomerate, which has since backed Snapdeal and Ola, poured $200 million into InMobi in 2011 but wrote down most of that amount in 2014.

According to these executives, InMobi, which was estimated to be valued at $1 billion, now generates between around $300 million in annual revenue. InMobi has not registered profits since its founding in 2007. InMobi's challenges have been compounded by the fact that its flagship product Miip -- that targeted global retailers like Walmart -- hasn't taken off.

The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves.

But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence.

For example, the world\\'s largest smartphone maker agonized over camera specs for its flagship Galaxy S7 until the last moment - ultimately defying industry convention by opting for fewer pixels in exchange for improved autofocus features and low-light performance, a move that contributed to early success. It also pared back its product line-up, overcoming internal resistance, enabling it to streamline production, an executive said. The handset business has now stabilized, and had its best profit in nearly two years in January-March, though historically low smartphone industry growth still leaves Samsung looking for the \"next big thing\". After peaking in 2013, a sharp drop in mobile profits exposed Samsung as slow to adjust to the changing market: its budget devices were overpriced and unappealing versus Chinese offerings, and the 2014 version of its Galaxy S flopped. That prompted a cull among executives and stoked investor worries Samsung might not be able to recover as rivals including Apple, Huawei \\xc2\\xa0and Xiaomi gained market share at its expense. There was no sweeping, across-the-board fix. Rather, Samsung embarked two years ago on an overhaul that included a shift from a phone-for-all-needs approach towards a line-up that emphasized economies of scale. It revamped design, using metal frames and curved screens, and gave high-end features such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens to its low- and mid-tier products. The product cull paid off; the revamped models helped Samsung recover in big markets such as India. \"There was a feeling the sheer number of phones in the market was confusing for customers,\" said a Samsung India executive, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with the media.Samsung\\'s Kim says his focus now is on premium-end smartphones - those costing $600 and above - where not all industry players have the muscle to compete.',\n",

Like many startups, Uber limits sales of its shares. Such transactions can distort a company's valuation, leave control in the hands of unknown investors and result in tax liabilities for the company, its employees and other shareholders. Uber declined to comment on the SharesPost proposal, but a spokeswoman said when Uber learns of potential unauthorized shares on the market, the company contacts the people involved.\\xc2\\xa0SharesPost's role in share sales has drawn regulatory scrutiny.

Both companies seek to curb costs by making rockets reusable and are conducting test launches more often.India plans to spend about 75 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) on its entire space program in the year through March 2017, a fraction of the yearly $19-billion-dollar budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the U.S. \\xc2\\xa0The reusable space vehicle is supposed to provide a cost-effective and reliable option for operations such as launching satellites, according to the Indian space agency.

With investors eager to get a piece of the next Uber or Airbnb, entrepreneurs often just lifted their little fingers to get financing. Some investors let the entrepreneurs choose their own terms, while others gave multimillion-dollar paydays to start-up founders long before their companies were a success. Now investors have the advantage. Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a start-up\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVenture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\\xc2\\xa0The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into start-ups in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the National Venture Capital Association; funding dropped 11 percent to $12.1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece.\\xc2\\xa0Investors have also been better able to negotiate financing terms that benefit them. According to a survey from the law firm Fenwick & West, investors of richly valued start-ups have been getting more provisions such as guaranteed payouts and minimum investment gains. Such terms are still relatively rare, but tend to become more common after the number and size of deals decline, said Barry Kramer, a Fenwick & West partner.\\xc2\\xa0Above all, investors are no longer paying any price to invest in a start-up. Since the beginning of this year, about 30 companies have had to settle for lower valuations than they previously received when they raised money, according to the research firm CB Insights. That is nearly as many as in all of 2015.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvestors have materially more time to do diligence than before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcross our portfolio, even for the best companies, fund-raising is a longer process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.\\xc2\\xa0Today there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value exchange-traded funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probably now considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already.\\xc2\\xa0Apple \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis going to attract more value investors,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C.

In fact, its sales team doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pitch products to anyone, because Atlassian doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a sales team.

The availability of open source alternatives has pushed traditional brands and rising challengers to offer more free trials, free basic versions of their software with paid upgrades, and online promotions. Incumbents such as IBM, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which employ thousands of commissioned salespeople, are acquiring open source or cloud companies that sell differently, says Laurie Wurster, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub are among the companies trying to attract corporate clients with small-bore efforts that rely largely on good reviews. The idea is to distribute products to individuals or small groups at potential customers big and small and hope interest spreads upstairs. So far, though, Atlassian remains the most extreme example of this model. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a 14-year-old company, valued at $5 billion since going public in December, without a single salesperson on the payroll.

The company also introduced Allo, a messaging app, and a rebranding of its virtual assistant.\\xc2\\xa0Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a quick explanation of what these major announcements, made at the Google I/O developer conference, mean for consumers.\\xc2\\xa0What do Home and Echo have in common?\\xc2\\xa0Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection.\\xc2\\xa0What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo?\\xc2\\xa0Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences:\\xc2\\xa0Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo.\\xc2\\xa0Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.)\\xc2\\xa0Most important, the brains of Home will be Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s virtual assistant, which draws from Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant to work with Google Home. In a recent test comparing virtual assistants from Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant was the most capable of performing basic tasks, largely because it drew data from Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s search engine.\\xc2\\xa0Is Home smarter than Echo?\\xc2\\xa0Thanks to Home\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reliance on Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Home\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it.',\n",

While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.\\xc2\\xa0The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.\\xc2\\xa0Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.\\xc2\\xa0Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.',\n",

That was a 375 percent jump from the 8 that did so at this time last year, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings calls transcripts. Nearly all were either consumer or technology companies, suggesting that virtual reality technology has a ways to go before becoming mainstream. Yet for all of the enthusiasm, there is little evidence that virtual reality can deliver substantial growth. here are few pure plays for investors who want to buy into virtual reality.\\xc2\\xa0Facebook Inc (FB.O), which paid $2 billion for its Oculus virtual reality division in 2014 and began shipping its first $599 Oculus Rift headsets in March, has the best-known virtual reality head gear, though other well-known companies including Google\\'s parent Alphabet and Apple are rumored to be working on high-powered headsets of their own.

       " b'For online lenders, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suddenly touch-and-go:\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0A year ago, privately held online lenders like Prosper, SoFiand Avant looked all but certain to go public at the same unicorn valuations their venture investors had assigned them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if not higher. They were seemingly reshaping the student, consumer and small business lending business. The market they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re chasing is enormous: The U.S. consumer lending market is a $3.5 trillion business, and 22 of \\xc2\\xa0the largest online marketplace platforms originated just more than $5 billion of unsecured consumer credit in 2014 and more than $10 billion in 2015. They also talked a big game. When SoFi raised a whopping $1 billion from Softbank last year, CEO Michael Cagney told Bloomberg: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking at over $1 trillion of market cap from the banks, and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all vulnerable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fast forward to today, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s online lenders that suddenly look like sitting ducks. In an SEC filing yesterday, Lending Club, which announced the surprise departure of its founder and CEO last Monday, revealed that investors who \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontributed a significant amount of funding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for loans are now examining that performance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor are otherwise reluctant to invest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For many casual observers in Silicon Valley, the first signs of trouble in the online lending category emerged in late April, when the WSJ reported that Avant made $514 million worth of new loans in the U.S. in the first quarter, a 27 percent drop from the fourth quarter of 2015. Then, two weeks ago, Prosper confirmed that it planned to cut roughly 28 percent of its staff in response to falling loan volume. And Prosper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news came just a day after OnDeck Capital said its own first-quarter losses had more than doubled as demand for its loans began to nosedive.\\xc2\\xa0Of course, the kicker came last week, when Lending Club CEO Renaud LaPlanche resigned following an internal audit that turned up $22 million in loans that were sold to Jefferies yet didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meet the investment bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criteria. Smartly, some players are already looking to reimagine themselves as broader financial outfits. For example, SoFi, which began as a way for students from top universities to refinance their debt, has since branched into personal loans, wealth management and mortgages.

The research suggests some consumers are reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using the Internet for everyday activities. The survey showed that nearly 20 percent of the survey's respondents had personally experienced some form of identity theft, an online security breach, or another similar problem over the year before the survey was taken last July. Overall, 45 percent said their concerns about online privacy and security stopped them from using the Web in very practical ways. The NTIA survey also showed that the more connected devices people owned, the more they experienced a breach of data. For those with only one laptop or computer or smartphone, 9 percent reported a security incident. That number more than tripled for those with at least five devices.\",\n",

While some people will point out that so-called \"private-labeling\" is nothing new -- grocery stores and big-box retailers have been increasingly pushing their in-house brands -- this is a much bigger deal.\\xc2\\xa0That\\'s because the growth in retail is all going to be online, and Amazon owns online. It already accounts for half of all sales growth in U.S. e-commerce.\\xc2\\xa0So Amazon\\'s move into consumer packaged goods gives it even more opportunity to flex its muscle with suppliers. That means giving its own products better placement on its site, and undercutting competitors on pricing.\\xc2\\xa0The move also offers Amazon the chance to pad its bottom line -- something Jeff Bezos hasn\\'t traditionally been willing or able to do. Private-label brands typically carry higher profit margins , in part because the companies selling them don\\'t put big marketing campaigns behind them.\\xc2\\xa0Think of the damage Amazon already does its to competitors as a low-margin business.

Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overworked teaching staff.\\xc2\\xa0But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.\\xc2\\xa0Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true identity to students until after they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d turned in their final exams.\\xc2\\xa0Students were amazed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wrote one in the class\\xe2\\x80\\x99s online forum. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another.\\xc2\\xa0Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.\\xc2\\xa0Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course\\xe2\\x80\\x99s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.\\xc2\\xa0As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.\\xc2\\xa0Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere can I find assignment two?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen is assignment two due?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.\\xc2\\xa0There are many questions Jill can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.\\xc2\\xa0Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t human.',\n",

Conrad was known to be a little frenzied and disorganized but fiercely intelligent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom an investment philosophy\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x89we look for the magnitude of the genius, as opposed to the lack of issues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Andreessen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founding partner Ben Horowitz. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd in a way, [Conrad] was like the prototype.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Conrad had no background in health insurance but quickly learned the intricacies of the business as well as any veteran. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re an insurance broker,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in 2013, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to drink your milkshake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xa0Then In California, they found, some of the sales team used Conrad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s macro to systematically cheat on the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s training course, which included a section on ethics. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs far as a company doing what Zenefits has done, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that we have seen this before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Nancy Kincaid, press secretary for the California Department of Insurance, which has also opened an investigation. In March, Massachusetts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 division of insurance opened a third. Zenefits confirms that other states have since followed but won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say which ones or even how many. Sacks became CEO and is guiding Zenefits through its crisis cleanup. He has banned alcohol at the office and changed the company motto from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReady. Fire. Aim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOperate With Integrity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In February the company laid off 250 employees, including the enterprise team. Sales Vice President Blond, Semaan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boss, and any executive or manager known to have helped disseminate the macro are also gone. Zenefits says it has self-reported the findings of its internal investigation to all 50 states and is working with those that have opened formal inquiries. Fidelity Investments, which owns a stake, has slashed its valuation of Zenefits from $4.5 billion to less than $2 billion. There are rows of empty desks at the San Francisco office; the company plans to downsize from four floors to three. The Star Wars-themed conference rooms will soon be renamed after inspirational entrepreneurs. Kegs have been replaced with cold-brew coffee. The stairwells are condom-free. Zenefits might also survive for the one reason that made its product so appealing to business owners in the first place: Shopping for health insurance remains really frustrating. The company says it now has 20,000 accounts. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs long as their problems don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect our company, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Todd Harmond, vice president for finance and operations of the e-book service Scribd, which uses Zenefits to offer Kaiser Permanente and Anthem health insurance plans to its 85 employees.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnless something else goes really wrong with Zenefits, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stick with them for a while,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says BlogMutt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Yates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much of a hassle to switch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

But almost every day companies pay her to snap photos of herself engaging in routine activities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, cleaning the bathroom.\\xc2\\xa0Her seemingly mundane images, when combined with thousands of others, contain insights that companies like Crest are eager to mine. They are using a Chicago-based company called Pay Your Selfie to gather those insights and present them in reports on consumer behavior that are meant to go where focus groups and surveys cannot.\\xc2\\xa0Among the tidbits that Crest, owned by Procter & Gamble, learned from its recent monthlong quest for selfies: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge spike in brushing from 4 to 6 p.m., probably tied to a desire for happy-hour fresh breath. That knowledge could be useful when Crest decides which times of the day to start future social media campaigns.\\xc2\\xa0Users of the app receive anywhere from 20 cents to $1 for each \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctask\\xe2\\x80\\x9d completed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in Crest\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, a snapshot taken \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhile brushing your teeth with your favorite Crest product.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Users can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t double-dip; the app allows only one selfie per task.\\xc2\\xa0The selfies are a good way for companies to obtain information that people can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t or don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t articulate in focus groups or other traditional research methods, said Ravi Dhar, director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management. For example, they could lead to an understanding of which rituals go along with certain types of consumption, he said.\\xc2\\xa0Pay Your Selfie, which has been in business since last September, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require participants to have followers on a site like Instagram. In fact, users don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to share their images publicly at all (although they can).

       " b'Companies are betting on a new way to protect your identity: the selfie:\\xc2\\xa0The selfie is about to get serious. Already ubiquitous at parties and for capturing Instagram-worthy landscapes, the act of raising a phone to your face and finding the perfect photo angle could take on a whole new role in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finances. Some banks, tax agencies and tech companies are making the selfie an integral step for people checking their bank accounts, shopping online and filing tax returns. Forced to find creative ways to guard against the rising threat of identity theft, a growing number of companies are moving from a system that tests people on what they know, such as a password. Now they want to ask consumers to provide evidence of something that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easily be changed or copied: their face. \\xc2\\xa0A photo also can serve as a way for consumers to offer proof that it was indeed them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and not an imposter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xc2\\xa0who made that purchase or submitted that form. For instance, MasterCard plans to roll out a service nicknamed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSelfie Pay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this summer through its member banks. Through the program, consumers would shop online as usual and after checking out, they would confirm the purchase by taking a selfie with a MasterCard mobile app. And Georgia will roll out a pilot program for the next tax season at the end of the year that gives taxpayers the option of creating a secure account where they verify their identities by taking a photo. If there is a match, taxpayers will be asked take a photo on their smartphones before their tax returns can be processed, ensuring the return was not submitted by a fraudster. To overcome that risk, the companies are requiring selfies that are a little different than the ones you might see on Facebook. After finding the right angle, consumers are asked to move around to confirm that the camera is capturing a live person and not a photo. In the MasterCard and USAA programs, users are told when to blink. Georgia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax program will prompt people to position their faces a certain way and scan for motion. \\xc2\\xa0',\n",

Baidu has come in for fierce online criticism for how it handles adverts within its search results, especially from an industry as sensitive as healthcare, which analysts at Nomura and Daiwa say provides 20 to 30 percent of its search revenues.\\xc2\\xa0In 2015 search revenues were 55.7 billion yuan ($8.6 billion), or 84 percent of Baidu\\'s total sales.\\xc2\\xa0\"Whatever page you\\'re looking at on Baidu is a mess of adverts,\" said username FreedLiu on China\\'s Weibo microblog, discussing Wei. \"They\\'re profiting from loads of people who don\\'t know Baidu auctions (its search results).\"\\xc2\\xa0Baidu said it applied particular vigilance to healthcare customers, with screening for misleading adverts and a verification program with additional scrutiny for medical advertisers.

Slowing growth at formerly fast-growing Square Capital, which lends to small merchants, also aroused concerns. The company said Square Capital lent $153 million in the first quarter, up just 4 percent from the preceding quarter, largely due to \"more challenging credit market conditions.\" The business acts as a middleman to offer funds to customers who can\\'t otherwise borrow easily.

He says having that core certainly is a differentiating factor in his view.\\xc2\\xa0Still there are similarities too. As with IBM, SAP has been working closely with Apple to bring its profound design sense to this endeavor. The objective of this partnership is no less than to revolutionize work on the iPad and iPhone, Lucas says.\\xc2\\xa0It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no secret that Apple wants a bigger piece of the enterprise market and these kinds of agreements help solidify their enterprise position and drive Apple hardware sales inside companies that were traditionally PC shops \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and hence more often considered Microsoft territory. Finally, much like IBM it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a deal without an educational component to round it out, so SAP is also offering SAP Academy for iOS as a training ground for SAP programmers to learn to use the HANA iOS SDK. Lucas says the company is absolutely committed to this educational effort and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something they will announce and go away in a few months, but a program that he sees lasting well into the future.\\xc2\\xa0While you might not see a natural fit between SAP and Apple, when the IBM partnership was launched in 2014, it certainly raised some eyebrows too, but by the end of last year the partnership had created 100 apps \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that number has surely increased since then.\\xc2\\xa0In fact, SAP is also planning on building 100 apps. The apps and the SDK are not yet available, but they say they should start to trickle out in Beta later this year.

One recent example was an integration with the Amazon Echo, in which users can ask with their voice how they are performing through their Fitbit devices.

Valic Co 1 marked down Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value by 29.4% as of February, compared with August 2015, according to a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Valic valued Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Series D stock at $98 a share in February, down from $139 a share in August.Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II marked down Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value by as much as 39.6% as of February, compared with last August, according to a filing with the SEC. Fidelity valued Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Series D stock at $82 a share in February, down from $135.8 a share in August. The Economic Times reported about the markdowns earlier on Wednesday. To be sure, Fidelity and Valic hold very small amounts of Flipkart stock. Their holdings together are worth less than $6 million. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a minuscule fraction of Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall value. The company last raised $700 million from investors in July last year at a valuation $15 billion. But taken along with other markdowns by Morgan Stanley and T Rowe Price, both of which together own hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Flipkart stock, it confirms the view that Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own investors believe the company is overvalued by a significant amount. In late February, Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust, another mutual fund investor in Flipkart, slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%. Then, last month, T Rowe Price disclosed in a filing that it cut the value of its stake in Flipkart by 15%.',\n",

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changing as the industry grows up and responds to pressure from regulators and investors. Amazon.com Inc. started breaking out stock-based compensation in the results of its different businesses in the first quarter. This is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts after the earnings report last week. Facebook Inc. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner had a similar message. From now on, he said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk about the social network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results and other metrics based on U.S. standards known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, which include equity-based pay costs, instead of a mix of GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe view it as a real expense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Some technology companies, such as Netflix Inc. and Intel Corp., already take this approach, but many don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. If the shift to focusing on the real bottom line catches on more broadly, it could slice billions of dollars off the reported profits and official forecasts that underpin the technology sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lofty market valuations. Facebook stock trades at about 35 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months. Add in equity compensation expense and that price-to-earnings ratio jumps to 50, according to a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysis. Amazon would trade at 122 times projected profit, rather than a multiple of 63. Using GAAP numbers, Alphabet Inc. would trade at 26 times forecast profit, versus 21 times, Bernstein estimates. The change also highlights the struggles of smaller Internet companies like Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. to generate GAAP earnings. Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet may have high stock valuations, but they are also very profitable by GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Twitter shares trade at about 36 times estimated profit, but including stock-based compensation analysts expect it to have a loss over the next 12 months, Bernstein research shows. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome companies have been egregious with stock compensation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fish said, citing LinkedIn, which has relatively high equity-based pay compared to its revenue and earnings.\\xc2\\xa0LinkedIn shares have declined 44 percent this year, while rival social network Facebook is up 13 percent.',\n",

A judge from the small Brazilian state of Sergipe ordered telecom providers in the country to block WhatsApp today in a dispute over access to encrypted data. Judge Marcel Montalvao has ordered WhatsApp to turn over chat records related to a drug investigation, but WhatsApp has argued that it cannot access the chats in an unencrypted form and therefore cannot provide the required records to the court.

But two weeks earlier, an unlikely source \\xe2\\x80\\x94the social media app Foursquare \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had beat Chipotle to the punch,predicting in a blog post that the burrito maker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales would drop nearly 30 percent. Chipotle made it official Tuesday afternoon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reporting a drop of 29.7 percent. \\xc2\\xa0The remarkably accurate prediction from a company consumers know for restaurant tips and the ability to check in at locations highlights the emerging power of the gobs of data our smartphones collect and the opportunity for savvy companies to convert that information into piles of cash. Foursquare has spent seven years collecting data and has 85 million places in its database. It describes its data trove as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbiggest foot traffic panel in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clients that buy Foursquare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data to glean insights include retailers, real estate developers, Wall Street traders and consumer package-goods companies.\\xc2\\xa0Foursquare, the seven-year-old start-up, cleverly turned smartphone data into predictions on Chipotle sales that matched Wall Street analysts with far more experience in projecting the successes of businesses such as Chipotle. Last year, Foursquare used its foot-traffic data to predict how many iPhones Apple would sell on a given weekend. Foursquarepredicted sales of 13 million to 15 million. Apple then announced sales of more than 13 million.Once a handful of Foursquare users have checked in at a location, the company knows that a given location represents a certain store. If the smartphones of another Foursquare user move inside these premises \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t check in \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Foursquare still knows the user was in the store. Foursquare relies on GPS data, WiFi, cell towers and beacons to pinpoint where smartphone users are.\\xc2\\xa0Data experts caution that there are limits to how far Foursquare can replicate its Chipotle predictions elsewhere. They say Foursquare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success will work best at large chains. Foursquare needs a lot of data to make such predictions, so it would probably struggle to accurately predict the sales of a retailer that has only a handful of locations.Another limitation to Foursquare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach is the nature of a store. Chipotle lends itself to a foot-traffic analysis because customers overwhelmingly travel in person to a store to get their food. It would be more difficult to predict the sales at a business that sells a significant amount of goods online.',\n",

       " b'Why is Facebook doing so well?\\xc2\\xa0Facebook reported yet another quarter of strong user growth, in marked contrast to Twitter, which has been eking out only very modest growth recently. In fact, over the past year Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monthly active users grew by roughly two-thirds the size of Twitter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entire base. This wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a one-off \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Facebook has grown by over 150 million users year on year for the past four years at least, and growth has actually accelerated recently: Predictably, the strongest growth has been in the least mature markets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Asia and Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRest of World\\xe2\\x80\\x9d geographic segments led the charge, with more than 75 million new users each over the past year, while North America and Europe added fewer users (but still grew decently). That reemphasizes the importance of Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to grow usage in those emerging markets and, hence, projects like Free Basics (recently shut down in India) and its other connectivity projects. So far, though, it seems to be doing just fine in these countries. \\xc2\\xa0Average revenue per user is also growing strongly across the board, led by the U.S. and Canada, where annual ARPU is approaching $50. Other regions have far lower ARPU \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the rest of the world combined has an annual ARPU of just $7. That overall ARPU growth multiplied by the user growth is driving phenomenal overall revenue growth. And, because that growth requires a much more modest increase in costs, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also driving margin expansion. Revenue grew by 52 percent year on year for the second quarter in a row, and operating margin was up 11 points year on year. Just as a reminder, that revenue is almost all coming from ads at this point \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the FarmVille era is well and truly over at this point, and payments are a tiny fraction of total revenue for Facebook today. One of the hardest things to get at in Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results is the role of Instagram. The app has been serving up ads for some time now, and management has been talking up the benefits in general terms for several quarters. But it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break out metrics other than monthly active users (400 million at last count). In addition, Instagram users are excluded from the MAU count Facebook reports and on which it bases its ARPU calculations, even though Instagram revenue is included in ARPU. As such, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little misdirection going on, in that Facebook is including Instagram in the numerator but not the denominator here.\\xc2\\xa0There is, to be sure, a good chance that many Instagram users are also Facebook users, so there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too much double counting, but I do wonder how much of the growth in ARPU is from Facebook monetizing Instagram better. From a perspective of internal threats to success, Facebook is placing some biggish bets on future projects like virtual reality (through Oculus) and research and development into new forms of connectivity, both projects outside its core business, and therefore both potential distractions and financial sinkholes. But the scope of these efforts seems to be modest in the context of Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall business, and its margins aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suffering yet. Government action on Free Basics, as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already seen in India, is another possible threat, but a modest one at this point, and one few other governments seem willing to take on for now. \\xc2\\xa0Perhaps the biggest threat of all is that platform owners like Apple and Google end up owning the next round of devices and platforms in the same way they have smartphones, despite Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s VR investments, and steadily squeeze out third parties they perceive as a threat. Facebook seems aware of this possibility, and has invested not just in VR as a potential future interface but also an increasingly OS-like presence on smartphones.',\n",

Tech geeks were chattering about the nitty-gritty of its features, and culture mavens debated whether it would become a game changer like the iPod or iPhone before it.\\xc2\\xa0And in the retail world, the major question was this: Would the arrival of a product that was not just a gadget, but also a luxury fashion item, push Apple to shake up its successful store format?\\xc2\\xa0The root of the speculation, or at least, the primary fuel for it, was a single paragraph in a New Yorker profile of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s design chief, Jonathan Ive. In that story it was reported that Ive and Angela Ahrendts, Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior vice president of retail, were working on a redesign of Apple stores, perhaps to make the setting more conducive to selling a luxury timepiece.

The company\\'s sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues. Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple\\'s share buyback and dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise. After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple\\'s exponential growth. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. \"The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,\" he said. He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales. Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion.

In 2013, Bezos paid what analyst Ken Doctor called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriendship premium\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of 17 times Ebitda; when Nikkei bought the FT, the going rate for European newspapers was 12 times Ebitda. Nikkei paid 35 times Ebitda. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a friendly offer, meaning Tribune might not play ball, but investors sure seem to dig it. Tribune Publishing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock opened the day by rocketing up more than 50 percent.

In the center is a plaza with a firehouse, police station and post office. There are shuttle buses, mega-cafeterias, landscaped lawns and koi ponds.

But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not too late to change its strategy. Flipkart is in the middle of a storm of its own making: It is faced with a significant management churn at the top. For a company that pioneered e-commerce in the country, growth has virtually stalled since the middle of last year and the leadership team hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figured out a way to kick-start sales. Its innovation engine isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t firing. In e-commerce lingo, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) sold over a given period of time has not grown substantially. In the offline world, it is the equivalent of saying, the sales or revenue numbers aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t growing. And this, for the e-commerce pioneer that until now grew its GMV by over 200% per annum for the past three years. The very culture that made Flipkart a runaway success in the first phase of its existence is now hindering its progress. The battle won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be easy. Amazon will unleash Amazon Prime, Amazon Fresh and may even partner with offline retailers to consolidate its position as the default destination for online shopping. Amazon has rapidly scaled up its seller ecosystem and outstrips Flipkart today in several product categories. It has a chance to win India\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that is being handed over on a platter thanks to the internal confusion at Flipkart. Amazon is here to play a 20 year game\\xe2\\x80\\x94and any fumbles will cost competitors heavily. Now imagine the Flipkart investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dilemma. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve poured in over $3 billion and own over 80% of the company. They are neck deep in a business that is burning $50-70 million a month and has to get ready for the next phase of battle in the market. If the cost-cutting moves misfire and market share starts to shrink, the founders could very well put a request for another $500 million for the fight against Amazon. What will the investors do? A new investor is unlikely to step in. Even though the Chinese e-commerce players like Alibaba are waiting in the wings to swoop down on prized assets in India, there's a chance that they could choose to wait out this stage of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evolution\\xe2\\x80\\x94why buy and restructure, when you can wait and buy a cleaned-up asset? Hence, one of the current investors will have to lead the round and it will put serious pressure on the team to show results. Flipkart has a last chance to redeem itself and take control of its destiny, else it will become another victim of early success. It is too big to fail and the market opportunity is too large to ignore. India will have more than one large e-commerce player\\xe2\\x80\\x94just the sheer potential of the market will keep it from consolidating for many years\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so, Flipkart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence is not in question. But the next few months will determine the destiny of the company. The A-team cannot afford to flounder so early in their journey.\\xc2\\xa0\",\n",

Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.\\xc2\\xa0Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.\\xc2\\xa0Last week, Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The about-face is startling, given Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record in China. Unlike many other American tech companies, Apple has succeeded in introducing several new products \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like its mobile payments system Apple Pay \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in China recently. New resistance from the Chinese government to that expansion could potentially hurt the Cupertino, Calif., company.\\xc2\\xa0To a degree more than many tech companies, Apple relies on the smooth operation of its software \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including its App Store and services like iTunes, which are tightly integrated with the iPhone and iPad \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to keep customers coming back to its devices. Apple, which is facing a slowdown in sales of its iPhones, is also reliant on China for growth, so further moves by Beijing to curtail services could crimp sales.\\xc2\\xa0The company counts China as its second-largest market after the United States. Its China numbers will be dissected on Tuesday, when it reports quarterly earnings.\\xc2\\xa0China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.\\xc2\\xa0China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sales in China for those companies, including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, have slid as government oversight has increased. Some have grappled with raids, investigations and fines. Some have also been pressured to sell off holdings, hand over technology and work with local partners to expand their China businesses.\\xc2\\xa0Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time - so far.',\n",

In Indonesia, Line built a classmate-connecting service after learning that alumni networks are a powerful social glue there. In Muslim countries, Line rolled out special features for people observing the Ramadan fast. All of this is aimed at getting new users hooked onto Line before they have a chance to become loyal to a rival service, such as Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp, or China's WeChat. That, along with Line's knack for making money from its app, bolsters the company's plan to hold an initial public offering as soon as this year. Line, a subsidiary of South Korean Internet company Naver Corp, now has more than 215 million monthly active users.\\xc2\\xa0One of Line's biggest foes in Asia is Tencent Holdings's WeChat, which boasts 697 million users. In some ways, WeChat is more than a just messaging service, with a myriad of features that let people book car rides, find dates and exchange money\\xe2\\x80\\x94all from within the app. Line isn't just good at reeling in new users, it also knows how to make money off of them.

Line is also targeting other Southeast Asian countries, the Middle East and even South America. The company now has 3,800 employees (average age, 31) supporting services in 19 languages.

       " b'Review: Curb, energy monitoring for an entire home:\\xc2\\xa0Curb is a comprehensive household energy monitoring system. The system monitors the entire home by using sensors installed in the circuit breaker. For many consumers this means being able to monitor the energy consumed by a clothes dryer or electric range or all the outlets and lights in a bedroom. It cannot, however, easily monitor and report how much energy is consumed by a computer or espresso machine.\\xc2\\xa0I had the system installed in my house over a month ago. It took licensed electrician about three hours. He had to install a sensor on each breaker and configure the system through an iPad app. This is not something an average homeowner can install themselves and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of the point.\\xc2\\xa0Curb aims to serve a homeowner with data not previously available. Other energy monitoring services either monitor the entire home or individual outlets. Curb sits in the middle of the two at the circuit break box. Each breaker gets a sensor and an app can display real-time consumption information as well as a dollar approximation of how much the energy is costing the homeowner. But what do I do with all this data? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where the system stops being useful. Obviously I can stop using my electric dryer and hang the clothes outside. Or teach my kids to turn off their lights. But I need help from there.\\xc2\\xa0The system should be able to display more historical data. Right now all it can do is show how much energy a particular circuit consumed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but now a total amount of watts. It can show how much power a home has consumed over a set of dates and also what the average was during that period. But what about the individual circuits? I want the system to let me dial down to a granule level.\\xc2\\xa0The web and smartphone app are basic at this point. The founder tells me the company is working towards implementing new features. The team is also playing with weekly emails that gives the consumer a breakdown of their energy usage and if anything abnormal occurred. Apparently, according to him, the system can identify when an appliance is consuming extra electricity, which could be a sign that it is nearing the end of its life.\\xc2\\xa0Currently, just after launch, the user experience of Curb leaves me wanting more. It is collecting so much information about my energy usage yet I feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not benefiting me in a major way. Of course I should use appliances less.Yet the system shows a lot of promise in surprising ways.\\xc2\\xa0A few weeks family and I were standing in line for the Easter Bunny. This was the day before Easter so we were in line for over an hour. And like any good parent, I spent the time putzing around on my phone. Mindlessly, I opened the Curb app and discovered the stove was drawing power though I thought I had turned if off. I texted my neighbor who went over and discovered the oven was still on.',\n",

It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits.\\xc2\\xa0Intel's shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion.\\xc2\\xa0Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents.\\xc2\\xa0Up to Tuesday's close, Intel's shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year. Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other businesses have small profits, or else lose money.\\xc2\\xa0That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business.

The figure also represents a decrease from the 2.4 million members the streaming service added internationally in the same period the previous year.\\xc2\\xa0That cloudy forecast sent shares down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as Netflix has tied its future to its bold global push. The company has been pouring resources into its expanding its international footprint, telling investors that it would run at break-even profitability until the end of 2016 as it continued to roll out the service abroad and increased its investment in content. That uncertainty over the competitive landscape, as well as fears about growth prospects both inside and outside the United States, overshadowed the generally positive first-quarter financial results that Netflix announced on Monday.\\xc2\\xa0The company beat expectations for profit and revenue growth during the first quarter. Profits totaled $28 million, up 16 percent from the same period last year, and total revenues increased 24 percent to nearly $2 billion.\\xc2\\xa0Netflix added a record 6.7 million total streaming members during the first quarter, bringing its total to 81.5 million, with about 42 percent outside the United States. Netflix had forecast that it would reach nearly 80.9 million total paid members in the quarter.\\xc2\\xa0In the United States, Netflix surpassed its forecasts for subscriber growth during a period in which price increases went into effect for some customers.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now mid-April 2016, and Facebook at Work is still in a closed beta.\\xc2\\xa0So what happened? Is Facebook at Work still part of the game plan? So things are still moving. Just slowly. And that matters because Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top competition, tech startup Slack, is growing quickly in the interim. Facebook said it has 450 companies using the pilot, up from 100 in August, including some big companies like the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has more than 100,000 employees. More importantly, though, Facebook says it has 60,000 businesses that have signed up for its waiting list. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of interested customers, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear how many of them would actually pay for Work or use the free model.\\xc2\\xa0Slack, for comparison, has more than two million users and more than 675,000 users who pay (or have employers who pay for them). That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more than 100,000 new paid users since December, the same time we thought Facebook would be out on the open market.\\xc2\\xa0Facebook has a tendency to turn small numbers into big numbers very quickly, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as though a few months\\xe2\\x80\\x99 delay means Facebook at Work can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ultimately be a hit. But at a conference dedicated to Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future, Facebook at Work was a side note. And side notes can be hard to remember.',\n",

The program was announced at a private event in San Francisco, where it showed off the fruits of various partnerships.\\xc2\\xa0The Periscope integration announced earlier this year is an example of what the company is hoping to achieve.

       " b'Artificial Intelligence for Everyday Use: How four programmers with almost no knowledge of Japanese designed software to read handwriting.\\xc2\\xa0Real-world artificial-intelligence applications are popping up in unexpected places\\xe2\\x80\\x94and much sooner than you might think.\\xc2\\xa0While winning a game of Go might be impressive, machine intelligence is also evolving to the point where it can be used by more people to do more things. That\\'s how four engineers with almost zero knowledge of Japanese were able to create software, in just a few months, that can decipher handwriting in the language.\\xc2\\xa0The programmers at Reactive Inc. came up with an application that recognizes scrawled-out Japanese with 98.66 percent accuracy. The 18-month-old startup in Tokyo is part of a growing global community of coders and investors who are harnessing the power of neural networks to put AI to far more practical purposes than answering trivia or winning board games.\\xc2\\xa0\"Just a few years ago, you had to be a genius to do this,\" said David Malkin, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning but can barely string two Japanese sentences together. \"Now you can be a reasonably smart guy and make useful stuff. Going forward, it will be more about using imagination to apply this to real business situations.\" While handwriting recognition might be considered deep-learning 101, Japanese is a whole other ballgame. That\\'s because the language includes symbolic characters such as kanji, which is composed of elements that can be read independently, making it difficult to know where one ends and another begins. There are also more than 2,000 common pictograms made up of dozens of strokes. The trick is to tackle one squiggle at a time. Reactive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s algorithm queries the neural network for a match, adds another stroke and repeats, all the while refining the probability of an accurate hit. The startup trained its model on about 1.8 million characters. Unlike a typical program built around rigid rules, deep-learning AI is modeled on how humans process information. Given enough data as inputs and a set of desired outputs, neural networks figure out what goes in the middle. This allows them to find solutions that have bedeviled traditional approaches, like interpreting speech or tagging images. And once built, a neural network doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be limited to language applications. In their spare time, the four Reactive engineers showed the program 5,000 dresses downloaded from Google Images, then gave it a picture of a woman in a revealing outfit. \"Sexy clothes,\" the software responded.',\n",

So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy.

Subsequent moves, including the takeover of much of Microsoft Corp\\'s advertising technology business, a deal to buy Millennial Media for about $250 million and the recent launch of the mobile video service go90, are also too recent to assess.\\xc2\\xa0Yet analysts have given the big phone company high marks for allowing AOL to operate independently and folding in other recent acquisitions without much drama.

Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from Applebee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to Zara \\xe2\\x80\\x94 could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.\\xc2\\xa0With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re conversational creatures,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d David A. Marcus, vice president of messaging at Facebook, said of chat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way our brain functions. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wired. As a result, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably the most natural interface there is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief executive, also sketched out his grand vision at the conference for the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future over the next five, 10 and 15 years.

       " b'Facebook built a 360-degree video camera, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s giving away the plans:\\xc2\\xa0Facebook finally shipped its new Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, a niche product that will likely be as cool as the games and videos you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re able to use with it.\\xc2\\xa0That means that Facebook has extra incentive (pressure?) to get people making great content for VR. At its F8 developer conference on Tuesday Facebook plans to unveil part of its plan to do just that: A new camera specifically for filming 360-degree videos, the kind of video that lets you pan or rotate within a scene so you can get a full 360-degree perspective. On top of the hardware, Facebook built a software program to stitch all the video together to create seamless 360-degree views of anything the filmmaker shoots.\\xc2\\xa0There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just one catch: You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually buy this camera anywhere. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because Facebook isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mass producing or selling the camera to the public. Instead, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open sourcing the camera\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specs and design, meaning the info needed to build the camera will be available to the public so that anyone with the time and money could build it on their own. So why would Facebook build a fancy 360-degree video camera and hand over the blueprints? Because Facebook has no interest in mass producing another piece of hardware. It wants 360-degree video content, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to manufacture a camera to get it. It just needs to show others how to make the camera instead. Oculus did something similar with the first version of its VR headset.\\xc2\\xa0Facebook is into all kinds of video content, not just 360-degree video. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also making a big push into live video,paying celebrities and media companies to use it new live video feature and putting the tool front and center in its main Facebook app in hopes more people will use it.\\xc2\\xa0The idea behind all of this is that getting more people to watch videos on Facebook will help the company sell video ads, which are more lucrative than static or banner ads.It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only company interested in 360-degree video either. Google partnered with GoPro a year ago for its own 360-degree camera, and it has been delayed by almost six months. Perhaps not coincidentally, Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 17-lens camera is one lens larger than Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 16-lens camera.

The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.\\xc2\\xa0To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.\\xc2\\xa0Last week, Indian regulators confirmed that online marketplaces, which had operated in a gray era, are legal. But they added a rule saying that no single seller can account for more than 25 percent of sales on such an e-commerce marketplace. It also limited the influence that online marketplaces can exert over the prices set by their sellers.\\xc2\\xa0The new regulations appear to make Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the site\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.\\xc2\\xa0The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R.

The findings show that venture investors are trying to play it safe by backing proven businesses, making it more difficult for newer startups to find capital.\\xc2\\xa0Last quarter had the fewest number of venture deals in four years. Funding rounds dropped 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, when startup funding began to slow. Investments totaled $17.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016, about flat with the prior period. More than half of that went to late-stage companies. Private investors are expressing skepticism as startup valuations have skyrocketed. Mutual fund companies have written down the value of their stakes in numerous technology companies since last year. Startups are staying private longer, leaving fewer options for shareholders to cash out. No tech company went public last quarter, and many of those that did in 2015 have gotten off to a rocky start.\\xc2\\xa0In other countries, there's plenty of money to go around.

       " b'The surprising thing that got the biggest share of online shopping dollars in 2015:\\xc2\\xa0In a new report from the online metrics firm ComScore, researchers aimed to capture the ways our online shopping habits did (and did not) change in 2015, and the results contain some surprises.\\xc2\\xa0ComScore analyzed which shopping categories drew the biggest online sales in 2015. Computer hardware \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a category that includes personal computers and tablets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been the leader for at least a decade. But last year, for the first time, spending on apparel and accessories took the e-commerce crown. In three of out of four quarters in 2015, apparel and accessories pulled down the most dollars. For the year, clothing generated $51.5 billion in online sales, slightly edging out $51.1 billion spent on personal computers and tablets. In some ways, this might seem logical: Tablets sales growth has slowed overall as shoppers instead opt for smartphones with bigger screens. But recall, too, that 2015 wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly a banner year for the apparel industry: Retailers from Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to Gap reported gloomy sales results as shoppers chose to spend their money on things like travel and dining out.\\xc2\\xa0So the fact that online clothing sales surpassed computer hardware sales is likely telling us something bigger about customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 online shopping patterns. For starters, it probably reflects retailers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 efforts to make it feel less risky to shop for clothes online. In other words, people are getting more used to the idea that if a pair of jeans doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit them quite as expected, or a sweater is not quite the same color blue it looked to be on a website, it can be returned with little hassle and often at no cost. Apparel also is among the categories that is seeing particular benefit from the explosive growth in shopping on smartphones. Lipsman said that many of the categories that registered particularly strong increases in online spending last year were ones in which the purchases are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9chighly considered,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning that customers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend much time researching before buying.\\xc2\\xa0These purchases are especially conducive to being made on a small screen, and so with the lion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of online shopping growth coming from mobile devices, they are getting a particular tailwind from this change in shopping habits.',\n",

       " b'Virtual Reality Check: Rating the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift:\\xc2\\xa0JUST a week after Facebook released the Oculus Rift, the first high-powered virtual reality device for consumers, a less publicized contender has arrived: the HTC Vive.\\xc2\\xa0Similar to the Rift, the Vive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a joint development by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and the video game distribution company Valve \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is a virtual reality headset that connects to a powerful computer.\\xc2\\xa0The Vive is even more expensive than the Rift \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it costs $799 for the headset and $1,000 to $2,000 for a compatible computer. Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99sOculus sells the Rift headset for $599, or $1,500 when the system is bundled with a computer.\\xc2\\xa0The main advantage of the HTC Vive headset is that it comes with motion controllers, which let you effectively reach out and grab objects in virtual reality. This kind of interaction feels much more natural for virtual reality than the game controller included with the Rift.\\xc2\\xa0Also, the Vive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion-sensing base stations capture richer movements, enabling people to walk around in a larger space or crouch and grab something while using virtual reality; the Rift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camera can detect movements, too, but the Rift was primarily designed to be used while standing or sitting.\\xc2\\xa0Another benefit of the Vive is that the headset fits better. With the Rift, I could always see a small gap in the space beneath the nose. The Vive headset completely blocks the outside world. HTC also includes a piece of foam that can be inserted into the Vive for a better fit for a narrower face.\\xc2\\xa0But a major downside of the Vive is the setup, which is more demanding than the Rift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. HTC recommends that you drill mounts into the ceiling to install the motion-sensing base stations to ensure that the sensors have a clear line of sight with the headset and your body. In other words, to take full advantage of the Vive, you probably need to dedicate a room to virtual reality; to use the Rift, you can get away with clearing out a bit of standing space.\\xc2\\xa0The other obvious downside of the Vive is the higher cost. With a computer and accessories included in the total price, the Vive will cost roughly $300 more than the Rift. Then again, if you are willing to spend more than $1,000 for virtual reality, that extra $300 might not matter much. This is Year 1 of powerful and capable virtual reality systems coming to the mainstream. Over time, the content that will become available for these devices will define their worth. There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much to do with either system yet, and consumers would be wise to wait to see if any killer virtual reality apps or games emerge for the systems.',\n",

Poor markings and uneven signage on the 3 million miles of paved roads in the United States are forcing automakers to develop more sophisticated sensors and maps to compensate, industry executives say. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the mundane issue of faded lane markings \"crazy,\" complaining they confused his semi-autonomous cars. In other developed countries, greater standardization of road signs and markings makes it easier for robot cars to navigate. In the U.S., however, traffic lights can be aligned vertically, horizontally or \"dog-house\" style in two columns.

The service might create a ride just for you, but just as often, it puts you in a ride that began long ago \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one that has spanned several drop-offs and pickups, a kind of instant bus line created from collective urban demand.\\xc2\\xa0In total, Uber collected about $48 for the ride, of which the driver kept $35. The company had collapsed five separate rides into a single trip, saving about six miles of travel and removing several cars from the road. For riders, the discounts amounted to savings of at least half of a standard Uber trip. For the driver, an hourlong trip with no idle time resulted in steady earnings (Uber drivers make money only when riders are in the car). And though Uber made less from the single ride than it would have from multiple rides, the company benefited by installing itself as a fixture in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives. UberPool may push us to re-evaluate how we think about Uber and its impact on the world.',\n",

But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a huge gap between how much time shoppers spend on mobile websites and apps, and the percentage of total e-commerce sales that happen on these mobile sites. One big reason for this 44 percent gap: Entering in credit card and shipping details on a phone can be a pain, both on mobile websites and in apps.\\xc2\\xa0Services like Apple Pay and Android Pay have eliminated a lot of that work in partnering apps, by filling in those details automatically.

       " b\"Elon Musk has a lot riding on his new Tesla:\\xc2\\xa0Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is poised to reveal his newest creation, the Model 3, at an event on Thursday. Starting at $35,000, the car represents Tesla's first electric vehicle aimed at price-conscious, mainstream consumers. And how it fares is going to have a major impact on Tesla's long-term future as a company \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the future of electric cars more broadly. That's why this unveiling is an incredibly important moment. Back in 2006, Musk laid out this vision in a blog post on Tesla's website: The strategy of Tesla is to enter at the high end of the market, where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model. In other words, this is the endgame. Although the company had focused first on high-end cars \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Tesla Roadster, the Model S, and the Model X \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the ultimate goal was to bring the electric car to the masses. So for Tesla to have reached this point is going to be, naturally, a very big deal in the company's history. But that's not the only reason the Model 3 is significant. Tesla's new car is important in a very immediate sense because it offers Tesla a big chance at reversing some of the headwinds facing the company. You may recall that in October, Consumer Reports dinged the Model S for reliability problems, even though the same publication had otherwise issued aglowing review of the vehicle. Meanwhile, Tesla sales may have been affected by low oil prices that could be suppressing demand for electric vehicles, even as internal production issues hindered the company's supply. Not all of that is Tesla's fault, but it has prompted analysts to sour on Tesla's stock. Over the latter half of 2015, shares of Tesla fell roughly 15 percent from about $280 a share to $240. (It's now hovering at $230.) The Model 3 could be Tesla's opportunity to regain momentum.\",\n",

Amazon now offers more than 1,200 services, the Seattle-based company said on Wednesday.

Amazon has also increased its warehouse capacity for large items like furniture and flat-screen televisions. A new shipping hub in Kansas announced last week will be among about a dozen Amazon warehouses specifically designed for big products. Others are in Connecticut and California. Amazon now sells more than 1 million items that give shoppers the option of requesting assembly, installation or other related services, which is boosting the sale of home-improvement products, said Erika Takeuchi, a spokeswoman for Amazon.

Chinese laws can be haphazardly enforced and are usually vague, and because the new rule is only a draft, analysts said they expected the regulator, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to specify later to whom the law would apply.\\xc2\\xa0If the rule applies to all websites, it will have major implications and will effectively cut China out of the global Internet. By creating a domestic registry for websites, the rule would create a system of censorship in which only websites that have specifically registered with the Chinese government would be reachable from within the country.\\xc2\\xa0If the law applies only to sites hosted in China, it would still represent a consolidation of power by Beijing. Forcing registration with Chinese entities is likely to create a new boom in domain-name service registrars. At the moment, Alibaba operates China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary domain-name service provider, called Wan Wang.\\xc2\\xa0The new rule would also enable the Chinese government to keep closer tabs on the real identities of website operators. It would also help Beijing assemble a registry of important websites if China wants to break away from the global registry that unifies the Internet, Mr. Creemers said. The new rules are the latest in a string of measures taken by the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping to assert control over the Internet. This year, regulators created rules to block foreign companies from publishing online content in China without the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consent.

It has both ethernet and phone jacks, and will work with most handsets except for old rotary phones, according to Kelly Mason, a company spokesperson. Google Fiber\\'s effort to draw in phone customers highlights how the company is becoming more like traditional service providers even as many telecom companies are looking to become more like Internet content firms. Even providers of cellphone service have been shifting their focus away from voice and toward the more lucrative provision of mobile data.

The company had an equity value of $8.4 billion last year.\\xc2\\xa0Funds associated with the private equity firm TPG as well as the investment firm Dragoneer put in $750 million of the $1 billion, with the rest coming from other institutional investors, the people said.

The terms give the investors the ability to convert to equity at a discount to an initial public offering price, two of the people briefed on the matter said.

With a headset, camera and game controller, the system, which costs $1,500 when bundled with a powerful computer, is the first virtual reality product of its kind to reach consumers, before similar ones coming this year from HTC and Sony. Over the last week, I tested the Rift and many pieces of content for the system to see how true Mr. Zuckerberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words might ring. I can report that while the Rift is a well-built hardware system brimming with potential, the first wave of apps and games available for it narrows the device\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely users to hard-core gamers. It is also rougher to set up and get accustomed to than products like smartphones and tablets. The Setup:\\xc2\\xa0The Rift works with technology that some might find anachronistic: a Windows PC, monitor, keyboard and mouse. With many people shifting away from desktop computers toward laptops, tablets and smartphones, finding a place to install the Rift and those other components may be a challenge. If you purchase the Rift, you had better have thick skin. The aesthetic of the headgear \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it looks like a pair of black ski goggles with air traffic controller headphones built into the sides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is not designed to get you a date. And since wearing the Rift makes users less aware of the outside world, videos and photos of them donning the contraption \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and taken without their knowledge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 may end up on Instagram or Facebook. I became a subject of ridicule when my partner was watching TV and I crouched in the middle of the living room while playing the dead space pilot game.\\xc2\\xa0The Rift has other consequences for the mind and body. I felt mentally drained after 20-minute sessions. My eyes felt strained after half an hour, and over a week I developed a nervous eye twitch.\\xc2\\xa0Oculus recommends Rift owners ease into the headset: Use it a few minutes at a time initially, then gradually increase the amount of time. All Rift users should take short breaks after every 30 minutes of use, the company said.\\xc2\\xa0The headset may also leave lasting impressions, or what I call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnerd paint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on your face. After a long session, the Rift left two sets of parallel horizontal lines under my eyes. When it comes down to it, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disagree with Mr. Zuckerberg that this is just the beginning of virtual reality. With about 30 games and a few apps available at Rift\\xe2\\x80\\x99s introduction, there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much to do with the system yet.

When fewer shares are outstanding, each one technically earns more.\\xc2\\xa0But a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall profit growth is unaffected by share buybacks. And comparing increases in earnings per share with real profit growth reveals the impact that buybacks have on that particular measure. Call it the buyback mirage.\\xc2\\xa0Consider Yahoo. The company bought back shares worth $6.6 billion from 2008 to 2014, according to Robert L. Colby, a retired investment professional and developer of Corequity, an equity valuation service used by institutional investors. These purchases helped increase Yahoo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings per share about 16 percent annually, on average.\\xc2\\xa0But a good bit of that performance was the buyback mirage. Growth in Yahoo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.\\xc2\\xa0Given these figures, Mr. Colby reckoned that Yahoo, if it had invested that same amount of money in its operations, would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.\\xc2\\xa0Yahoo is not alone. Mr. Colby conducted a cost-benefit analysis of 26 companies buying back stock versus using that money to invest in a business.\\xc2\\xa0He found that McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was another problematic example. Since 2008, McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has allocated almost $18 billion to buybacks. This has helped produce 4.4 percent increases in annual earnings per share over the period.

They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just less headache than old-world services, but because they were using phones to eliminate inefficiencies, they argued that they could be cheaper, too \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so cheap that as they grew, they could offer luxury-level service at mass-market prices. So do a lot of other apps offering services across a number of industries. They are super convenient, but the convenience comes at a premium, which seems here to stay. Some of these services could make for fine businesses, but it is hard to call them groundbreaking. After all, paying extra for convenience isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really innovative \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is pretty much how the world has always worked. Before we get to why many on-demand apps have struggled to achieve mass-market prices, it is important to remember why anyone ever thought they could: because Uber did it. The ride-hailing company that is valued by investors at more than $60 billion began as a luxury service. The magic of Uber was that it used its growth to keep cutting its prices and expand its service. Uber shifted from a convenient alternative to luxury cars to an alternative to taxis to, now, a credible alternative to owning a car. But Uber\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success was in many ways unique. For one thing, it was attacking a vulnerable market. In many cities, the taxi business was a customer-unfriendly protectionist racket that artificially inflated prices and cared little about customer service. The opportunity for Uber to become a regular part of people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives was huge. Many people take cars every day, so hook them once and you have repeat customers. Finally, cars are the second-most-expensive things people buy, and the most frequent thing we do with them is park. That monumental inefficiency left Uber ample room to extract a profit even after undercutting what we now pay for cars.\\xc2\\xa0But how many other markets are there like that? Not many. Some services were used frequently by consumers, but weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that valuable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 things related to food, for instance, offered low margins. Other businesses funded in low-frequency and low-value areas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere a trap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Walk said.',\n",
       " b'Why you should be skeptical that any video is real:\\xc2\\xa0Be careful about believing what your eyes are telling you. Researchers have shown how a video of a person talking can be altered in real time to change what a speaker appears to be saying.\\xc2\\xa0In a new video, the scientists show how they edited YouTube clips to change mouth movements. The system uses a webcam to track one person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s facial expressions, and then applies them to the face of the person in the target video.\\xc2\\xa0The software creates a 3D representation of a subject\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face, which can then be swapped with the 3D representation of another face. The process works even if one subject has facial hair or a different skin tone. But it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work if a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long hair blocks his or her mouth. Currently the researchers are considering commercializing the technology for use in TV shows that are re-released in a different language. Editing actors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 facial movements to match the audio should make the dubbed programs seem more natural, even if what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s onscreen is actually fake.',\n",
       " b'Square Teams Up With Facebook to Offer Ads That Can Be Gauged:\\xc2\\xa0On Wednesday, Square announced a new integration with Facebook. Under the integration, small businesses that use Square to process payments can buy and target Facebook advertising using Square\\xe2\\x80\\x99s software. Square will make subscription fees off the new product. Small businesses can benefit from the move because Facebook ads bought through Square\\xe2\\x80\\x99s platform are directly connected to sales activity and data, Square said. That will allow business owners to understand whether their Facebook ads are working to attract new and repeat customers. The Facebook ad integration is just the most recent new line of business for Square, which went public in November. When the company began in 2009, it focused on providing a square credit card reader that easily attached to smartphones and tablets, giving small, cash-only businesses the ability to accept credit cards. Square takes a small percentage of each transaction, a fee it splits with credit card companies and other financial intermediaries. But as Square has grown, the company has diversified from that payments processing core, which some analysts and investors have criticized for having overly thin margins. Square now offers cash advances to merchants through Square Capital, scheduling with Square Appointments and food delivery with Caviar. The company has also begun offering other subscription-based products to businesses, like an email marketing service linked to sales history. The new Facebook advertising integration was spurred by an acquisition of talent and technology from a start-up called LocBox a few months ago. Square hired Mr. Mehta and his colleagues from LocBox, which specialized in online marketing for small and local businesses, to work on similar advertising technology at Square. The new lines of business still account for far less revenue than Square earns by processing payments. But Square believes that as more small businesses begin adopting its full array of products, these nascent revenue streams will grow. Two weeks ago, Square reported its first quarterly earnings as a public company, posting a 49 percent revenue increase to $374 million for the fourth quarter from a year ago, with sales from its software and data products more than tripling.',\n",

It will be big and clunky, expensive, and cause nausea and other problems for its users. Within a few months, we will declare our disappointment with virtual reality itself while Facebook listens very carefully to its users and develops improvements in its technology. Version 3 of this, most likely in 2018 or 2019,will be amazing. It will change the way we interact with each other on social media and take us into new worlds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like the holodecks we saw in the TV series Star Trek.\\xc2\\xa0This is the way innovation happens now. You release a basic product and let the market tell you how to make it better. There is no time to get it perfect; it may become obsolete even before it is released.\\xc2\\xa0Apple hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figured this out yet. It maintains a fortress of secrecy and its leaders dictate product features. When it releases a new technology, it goes to extremes to ensure elegant design and perfection. Steve Jobs was a true visionary who refused to listen to customers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 believing that he knew better than they did about what they needed. He ruled with an iron fist and did not tolerate dissent of any type. People in one division of Apple also did not know what others in the company were developing, that is the type of secrecy the company maintained. Jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tactics worked very well for him and he created the most valuable company in the world. But without Jobs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and given the dramatic technology changes that are happening, Apple may have peaked. It is headed the way of IBM in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9990s and Microsoft in the late 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Consider that its last major innovation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the iPhone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was released in June 2007.\\xc2\\xa0Since then, it has been tweaking its componentry, adding faster processors and more advanced sensors, and releasing this in bigger and smaller form factors\\xe2\\x80\\x94as with the iPad and Apple Watch. Even the announcements that Apple made Monday were uninspiring: smaller iPhones and iPads. All it seems to be doing is playing catch up with Samsung, which offers tablets and phones of many sizes and has better features. \\xc2\\xa0It has been also been copying products such as Google Maps and not doing this very well.',\n",

       " b'Chip-Card Payment System Delays Frustrate Retailers:\\xc2\\xa0Avi Kaner, a co-owner of the Morton Williams supermarket chain in New York, has spent about $700,000 to update the payment terminals at his stores. Trouble is, he cannot turn them on. The new terminals can accept credit and debit cards with embedded digital chips, a security feature intended to reduce the number of fraudulent purchases. But before the payment systems can work, they must be certified, a process that Mr. Kaner and many retailers around the country are waiting to happen. In the case of Morton Williams, the holdup has lasted several months. The cost of waiting, retailers say, is piling up. Until recently, banks covered much of the cost of fraudulent purchases. Since Oct. 1, though, merchants that cannot accept chip cards have had to shoulder the cost of fraud, and banks have not been shy about passing along the bill. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been very frustrating,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kaner said in an interview last week at his office in the Bronx, the home of his family-owned business. He bought most of the equipment he needed before Oct. 1, he said, and has been waiting months to get it certified. The delay, he said, pointing to a tall pile of paperwork, has cost him thousands of dollars in payments for fraudulent purchases. The long delays are just the latest black eye for the deployment of the new systems. Some consumers have not yet received new cards. Many merchants have not bought the updated equipment. And even when the cards and the terminals have been updated, they have generated confusion and slow lines. Many of the complications were widely predicted, but the certification system has added an unexpected wrinkle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and lots of finger-pointing.

The Hungarian-born refugee was one of the founders of Santa Clara, California-based Intel, playing a key role in building the company from a startup in the 1960s to the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest semiconductor maker, a title it still holds. Grove, who literally wrote the book on how to foresee and overcome a corporate crisis with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly the Paranoid Survive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also broke new ground by making the component maker a household name central to the worldwide adoption of the personal computer.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Arriving in the U.S. with less than $20 in his pocket, Grove was taken in by relatives in New York. He studied chemical engineering at City College and graduated at the top of his class, teaching himself English along the way.He moved to the West Coast to attend the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 1963. After graduating, he joined\\xc2\\xa0Fairchild Semiconductor, home to a future group of semiconductor industry leaders who would give Silicon Valley its name.

So where is it happening? Here are a few behind-the-scenes applications that make life better every day.\\xc2\\xa0Making user-generated content valuable:\\xc2\\xa0The average piece of user-generated content (UGC) is awful. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually way worse than you think. It can be rife with misspellings, vulgarity or flat-out wrong information. But by identifying the best and worst UGC, machine-learning models can filter out the bad and bubble up the good without needing a real person to tag each piece of content. Pinterest uses machine learning to show you more interesting content. Yelp uses machine learning to sort through user-uploaded photos. NextDoor uses machine learning to sort through content on their message boards. Disqus uses machine learning to weed out spammy comments.\\xc2\\xa0Finding products faster:\\xc2\\xa0Successful e-commerce startups from Lyst to Trunk Archive employ machine learning to show high-quality content to their users. Other startups, like Rich Relevance and Edgecase, employ machine-learning strategies to give their commerce customers the benefits of machine learning when their users are browsing for products.\\xc2\\xa0Engaging with customers:\\xc2\\xa0You may have noticed \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontact us\\xe2\\x80\\x9d forms getting leaner in recent years. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another place where machine learning has helped streamline business processes. Instead of having users self-select an issue and fill out endless form fields, machine learning can look at the substance of a request and route it to the right place. Understanding customer behavior: Machine learning also excels at sentiment analysis. And while public opinion can sometimes seem squishy to non-marketing folks, it actually drives a lot of big decisions. For example, say a movie studio puts out a trailer for a summer blockbuster. They can monitor social chatter to see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resonating with their target audience, then tweak their ads immediately to surface what people are actually responding to - that puts people in theaters.',\n",
       " b'Why unicorns falter:\\xc2\\xa0In early February 2016, a study of financing deals reported by The Wall Street Journal found that investors are increasingly protecting themselves from IPOs that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perform as expected. This fallout is a continuation of the demise of the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunicorn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a tech startup with a pre-IPO valuation of over one billion dollars.\\xc2\\xa0As these companies secure late-stage funding before their public market exit, smart private investors are setting terms that ensure they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose a dime if the IPO falls short of expectations. This comes at a great cost to the startup if the exit doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deliver, as was the case for many of the IPOs of 2015. The unicorn investment cycle has been consuming the growth ramp of an IPO-bound company. Unlike previous eras when a public exit occurred earlier in the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth, leaving the best days ahead of the company, the fastest growth for an IPO-bound startup now happens in the last funding rounds before an IPO. This leaves a 20-30 percent growth rate post-IPO, which is pretty good for a company at $100-$200 million/year revenue, but bad for anyone looking for greater than 2X ROI from an IPO investment. Addressing these issues requires a little course correction as companies work toward an IPO. To ensure ample room for future growth, a startup should be careful not to push its market cap too high by taking more funding rounds than needed during the growth-stage period before IPO. This can be a challenge because funding often generates media interest and credibility, which are certainly not things a young company wants to leave on the table.\\xc2\\xa0However, leaving a portion of its growth for the IPO will ensure that the company has enough runway to continue to grow and deliver for its public market investors, just as the company has done for its VCs. Otherwise, you create yet another unicorn where the late-stage investors garner all the potential gains, and even force guarantees on returns.

The rare meeting, reported by China\\'s state news agency Xinhua, suggests warming relations between Facebook and the Chinese government, even as Beijing steps up censorship of and control over the Internet. Liu, who sits on the Communist Party\\'s Politburo Standing Committee which is the apex of power in China, praised Facebook\\'s technology and management methods, Xinhua said. Zuckerberg was in Beijing for the China Development Forum, a government-sponsored conference bringing together top business executives and the country\\'s ruling elite. China \"hopes (Facebook) can strengthen exchanges, share experiences and improve mutual understanding with China\\'s Internet companies\", Xinhua quoted Liu as telling Zuckerberg. On Friday, Zuckerberg posted an image of himself running through smog in Beijing\\'s Tiananmen Square, past the portrait of the late Chairman Mao Zedong hanging over the Forbidden City. The 31-year-old has achieved celebrity status in China, one of the few markets where Facebook and other foreign Internet platforms, including Alphabet Inc\\'s Google services and Twitter Inc, are not available due to tight government controls. He has long sought to improve his company\\'s relationship with the Chinese authorities, and now sits on the advisory board of the School of Economics and Management at China\\'s elite Tsinghua University.',\n",

Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to requests for comment. Google acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader.\\xc2\\xa0At the heart of Replicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the unit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term.\\xc2\\xa0Tensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them.\\xc2\\xa0The November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group. In the meeting, Rosenberg said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe as a startup of our size cannot spend 30-plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years,\" and that \"there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and (that) needs to be a few years.\"',\n",

       " b\"Why students are throwing tons of money at a program that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give them a college degree:\\xc2\\xa0One of the biggest booms in the job market right now: an influx of coders graduating from three- to six-month coding crunch programs in lieu of traditional four-year Computer Science degree programs. These for-profit programs, non-accredited and operating without much regulation, have been cropping up in response to a swelling market demand for STEM workers. They vary in quality, but most bootcamps promise steady, high-paying work upon graduation, prompting aspiring coders to invest anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 of personal money to enroll.\\xc2\\xa0Now, colleges and universities are teaming up with these private schools, or rolling out their own bootcamp-style programs to offer accelerated coding workshops to their students. Northeastern, UPenn, and Rutgers have announced in-house bootcamps in the couple of months, while Lynn University and Concordia University have paired with programs like General Assembly and The Software Craftsmanship Guild. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a response to thetremendous growth in bootcamp enrollment, which increased by 138 percent from 2014 to 2015, compared to more modest growth in traditional Computer Science degrees (14 percent from 2013 to 2014). The demand is clear. But should universities be borrowing bootcamp tactics? O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Neill, who is Principal Architect at Monetate, agrees. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skeptical of bootcamper applicants and is more inclined to hire four-year CS degree graduates, especially for the most in-demand positions: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull stack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d developers who possess a range of coding skills. He compares the skillsets of bootcampers to performing auto repair on a car, versus the kind of large-scale, architectural skills of your standard CS degree holder, who can do everything from small repairs to making deep structural changes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou emerge from a bootcamp fit to do an oil change, but not design a car,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. A typical four-year CS degree will require students to study theoretical principles of programming on top of straight coding skills. Bootcamps, on the other hand, focus on programming alone, with an emphasis on in-demand languages in popular sectors like app development, functioning more like vocational school. But Anupam Joshi sees the immediate benefits of these programs. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chair of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, which doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t currently have plans to incorporate bootcamp style programs into its CS department (though the university does have a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraining center\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that offers vocational services, including coding). But he appreciates the bootcamps' quick adaptability to industry fads and the wider scope of needs they fill amidst the student body. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBootcamps are good for someone who wants to get an entry level job,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of the promotion of coding over theory. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like every other trade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\",\n",

Three of the sources, who are top-level executives in venture capital and private equity firms, said Amazon made a preliminary offer of up to $8 billion to acquire Flipkart, nearly half of its previous stated valuation of $15.2 billion. A mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley slashed the value of its Flipkart shares by 27% last month to about $11 billion, increasing speculation that new investors will back the company at a lower valuation. Flipkart-Amazon talks went cold after the offer was perceived to be too low, but the sources said the situation can change given Alibaba's interest in Flipkart.\",\n",

He stared at the board, then got up from the table and left the room.\\xc2\\xa0As Sedol returned after a few minutes and pondered his next move, it became clear that AlphaGo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move was no mistake. It might be strange, but it definitely wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bad. It was brilliant. \\xc2\\xa0Sedol would take almost 16 minutes to make his next move. He would never recover, losing the match.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlmost no human pro would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve thought of it, I think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Redmond said after the match. Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington and author of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Master Algorithm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d saw a parallel between AlphaGo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style and how chess prodigy Bobby Fischer was feared because his early moves were considered too foolish to even be made.

We did some asking around and yes, it does appear that Apple has made some moves to diversify its iCloud storage, tapping Google for some of that business.\\xc2\\xa0This is another huge win for Google and a \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at the very least perceived \\xe2\\x80\\x94 loss of ground for AWS, which has watched as Dropbox moved large parts of its US storage business in-house and Spotify moved at least part of its business to Google, too.\\xc2\\xa0If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re keeping score, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a good month for Google and especially the new head of its cloud business Diane Greene. High profile clients like Spotify and Apple would certainly make it more attractive to other enterprise customers. Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cloud Platform may have the power of Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data center technology behind it, but that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet helped the company in competing against AWS and Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Azure platform. AWS has the advantage of an early start and Azure profits from Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing sales channels and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focus on hybrid cloud technologies. And even with the power of Microsoft behind it, though, Azure remains a distant second in the cloud business.\\xc2\\xa0One industry insider who chose not to be identified, however, told TechCrunch that Apple was definitely exploring its options around public cloud vendors, looking at Microsoft Azure and Google, but it had not made any firm decisions yet. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth noting that Apple already uses \\xc2\\xa0Azure (and AWS) for iCloud services and media serving.\\xc2\\xa0Whether Apple will continue moving off of AWS and onto other platforms is anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guess. But at the moment it appears that this is a matter of diversifying its portfolio of cloud suppliers.\\xc2\\xa0Another wrinkle here is that Apple is currently expanding its data center in Prineville, Oregon, and is also expected to invest heavily in new data centers in both the U.S. and Europe. If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the case, moving from AWS to Google, then Google to Prineville wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to make sense. Why not just wait until the data center construction is complete?If Apple is indeed simply looking to diversify its infrastructure, though, then adding Google (on top of Azure, AWS and its own data centers) would be a fairly logical move. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also possible that Apple is only looking at some very specific services on the Google cloud, with theBigQuery data analytics platform being the prime suspect here.',\n",

       " b\"Uber Could Give Us a Lesson in Productivity:\\xc2\\xa0In Los Angeles, traditional taxi drivers have a passenger in the car for 40.7 percent of the miles they drive. By contrast, Uber drivers have a passenger in the car for 64.2 percent of their miles, or a 58 percent higher capacity utilization rate. In Seattle, the other city surveyed with mileage data, Uber drivers were 41 percent more productive. When measured by time, Uber drivers in Boston, San Francisco and New York on average have a passenger in their car about half the time their smartphone app is turned on. That compares to a range of 32 percent of the shift for taxi drivers in Boston to 49.5 percent for cabbies in New York. The service's use of internet-based mobile technology to connect passengers and drivers certainly contributes to its efficiency, according to the report. It makes sense: tapping your smartphone screen a few minutes before you need a ride is often easier than waiting on a street corner and hoping an empty cab drives past. Meanwhile Uber allows drivers to set their own shifts, and when combined with their use of so-called surge pricing that increases fares during times of increased ridership, supply and demand are more smoothly matched. Uber drivers are also exempt from regulations that prevent taxi drivers who drop off a passenger in a jurisdiction outside the one that granted their occupational license from picking up another customer in the same location. Given their 38 percent advantage, Uber drivers could charge 28 percent less than traditional taxis and still earn the same amount per hour under certain assumptions, including ignoring fixed costs, according to Cramer and Krueger. That may be one reason investors last year valued the company at $62.5 billion, more than Ford Motor Co., \\xc2\\xa0General Motors Co., and 80 percent of companies in the S&P 500.\",\n",

This is essentially how Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feed works, and how Twitter recently reconfigured its feed to work. On the one hand, the relevancy-optimized Instagram feed will make sure you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t miss great content even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t neurotically check it all the time. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to follow more accounts without worrying about them drowning out your favorites. And it will be easier to keep up with international friends who might normally post while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asleep.\\xc2\\xa0At the same time, remixing the feed will make Instagram less useful as a real-time content feed because the most recent posts won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily be at the top. Users will have to worry about making their posts good enough to be chosen by the algorithm or their posts could be de-prioritized. And brands might lose the reach of a previously reliable marketing channel, the same way they did with Facebook Pages.\\xc2\\xa0Filtered feeds tend to score more attention from users, as there are few boring posts that push them to close the app and do something else.

The newest version of the Snapdeal app already includes integrations with travel booking service Cleartrip, food-delivery service Zomato and bus-booking service Redbus. As Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl told Re/code last April, the company believes it can differentiate from e-commerce competitors Flipkart and Amazon by broadening its focus beyond selling physical retail products.

After being asked her name and address, she was taken to see a physician who reviewed her medical history, asked several questions, and ordered a series of tests including blood and urine. These tests revealed that her fetus was healthy but Kaur had dangerously low hemoglobin and blood pressure levels. The physician, Alka Choudhry, ordered an ambulance to take her to a nearby hospital.\\xc2\\xa0All of this, including the medical tests, happened in 15 minutes at the Peeragarhi Relief Camp in New Delhi, India. The entire process was automated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from check-in, to retrieval of medical records, to testing and analysis and ambulance dispatch. The hospital also received Kaur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical records electronically. There was no paperwork filled out, no bills sent to the patient or insurance company, no delay of any kind. Yes, it was all free.\\xc2\\xa0The hospital treated Kaur for mineral and protein deficiencies and released her the same day. Had she not received timely treatment, she may have had a miscarriage or lost her life. The technology that made the instant diagnosis possible at Peeragarhi was medical device called the Swasthya Slate. This $600 device, the size of a cake tin, performs 33 common medical tests including blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, blood haemoglobin, urine protein and glucose. And it tests for diseases such as malaria, dengue, hepatitis, HIV, and typhoid. Each test only takes a minute or two and the device uploads its data to a cloud-based medical-record management system that can be accessed by the patient.\\xc2\\xa0The Swasthya Slate was developed by Kanav Kahol, who was a biomedical engineer and researcher at Arizona State University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s department of biomedical informatics until he became frustrated at the lack of interest by the medical establishment in reducing the cost of diagnostic testing. He worried that billions of people were getting no medical care or substandard care because of the medical industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motivation in keeping prices high. In 2011, he returned home to New Delhi to develop a solution. By Jan. 2013, Kahol had built the Swasthya Slate and persuaded the state of Jammu and Kashmir, in Northern India, to allow its use in six underserved districts with a population of 2.1 million people. The device is now in use at 498 clinics there. Focusing on reproductive maternal and child health, the system has been used to provide antenatal care to more than 22,000 mothers. Of these, 277 mothers were diagnosed as high risk and provided timely care. Mothers are getting care in their villages now instead of having to travel to clinics in cities. A newer version of the Slate, called HealthCube, was tested last month by nine teams of physicians and technology, operations, and marketing experts at Peru\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading hospital, Clinica Internacional. They tested its accuracy against the western equipment that they use, its durability in emergency room and clinical settings, the ability of minimally trained clinicians to use it in rural settings, and its acceptability to patients. Clinica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general manager, Alvaro Chavez Tori, told me in an email that the tests were highly successful and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacceptance of the technology was amazingly high.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He sees this technology as a way of helping the millions of people in Peru and Latin America who lack access to quality diagnostics.',\n",

But, in theory, the streaming method lets them grab devoted game players who have tried out the game, like it, and will stick around and buy stuff therein. For Google, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another way to nab the ample flow of app promotional dollars \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a flow that Facebook has largely cornered. Over the past year, Google has rolled out a stream of mobile app advertising tools as the company has prioritized ways to fortify its central business. It added ads to the Play store so developers could pay to get noticed there. In November, Google started testing app streaming in organic search results with a handful of apps; it brought the feature to ads within apps a month later. Now, developers can promote their apps with streaming inside search, too. Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of app advertising is rising steadily, although Facebook is still out in front, according to industry sources.',\n",

This would make it the first among peers, including those several times bigger, to go public. Infibeam had received a green signal from securities market regulator SEBI for its initial public offering (IPO) to raise up to Rs 450 crore last October. \\xc2\\xa0Founded in 2010 by a former Amazon executive, Vishal Mehta, Infibeam would also become one of the youngest firms to list on a national bourse. Having restricted itself from raising private capital, unlike its peers, it did not get too aggressive in customer acquisition to drive the B2C business and has been especially pushing the B2B e-commerce enabler platform BuildaBazaar. Infibeam would be the first pure-play e-commerce firm in the country to float an IPO in India and would test the general investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 appetite for the sector. E-commerce in India has absorbed billions of dollars over the past four years, much of it from foreign private equity and venture capital firms. Infibeam happens to be an exception as it has not approached any major private investor for funds till now. It is promoted by a Gujarat-based affluent family whose business interest straddles a dealership for Toyota cars. Interestingly, Infibeam made profit in the first six months of the current financial year. It reported net revenues of Rs 171.27 crore for the April-September 2015 period with EBITDA of close to Rs 15 crore and net profit (adjusted for prior period items) of Rs 6.5 crore. It had clocked net loss of just under Rs 10 crore for 2014-15. As of December 31, 2015, it had 48,724 registered merchants on the BuildaBazaar platform. In Infibeam.com e-retail site, in addition to direct sales procured from suppliers, it had more than 5,000 registered merchants, and claimed to have more than 7.8 million active users (based on last login in the immediately preceding 12 months). To its credit, it is one of the rare horizontal e-commerce platforms to have survived without large external funding. Others like IndiaPlaza shut down as they failed to get follow-on funding, and as a consequence, investors funding got concentrated to the troika of Flipkart, Snapdeal and ShopClues. Global e-commerce behemoth Amazon itself has built a big presence in India and is among the top three ventures in the country. Infibeam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only external equity funding has come from media house Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd, which bet around Rs 33.3 crore through the ad-for-equity investment platform Brand Equity Treaties Ltd (BETL). BETL owns a 1.8 per cent stake in the firm. BETL also pitched in with Rs 2 crore of non-convertible debentures, which are outstanding.',\n",

A group of researchers at the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford University has been exploring the limits of friction in the design of tiny robots that have the ability to pull thousands of times their weight, wander like gecko lizards on vertical surfaces or mimic bats.\\xc2\\xa0Now they have pushed biomimicry in a new direction. They have taken their inspiration from tiny ants that work as teams to move massive objects. In this case, they are not just taking ideas from nature \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the movie \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Hero 6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d made a great deal of what swarms of microrobots could do, including tossing cars.\\xc2\\xa0The researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 approach is counterintuitive. Rather than striking powerful blows like a football player making a tackle or a jackhammer, they have focused on synchronizing the smooth application of very tiny forces.

Their new demonstration is the functional equivalent of a team of six humans moving a weight equivalent to that of an Eiffel Tower and three Statues of Liberty, Mr. Christensen said. The car is the one he uses for commuting to campus. Part of the magic is the use of a special adhesive that was inspired by gecko toes.\\xc2\\xa0',\n",

Today, its market share has nearly halved, several top executives have resigned, and the company is looking for growth outside India.\\xc2\\xa0In Micromax\\'s slide to second place is a tale of the promise and peril of India\\'s booming but hyper-competitive smartphone industry.\\xc2\\xa0India is the world\\'s fastest-growing smartphone market. Shipments of smartphones jumped 29 percent to 103 million units last year.\\xc2\\xa0Rapid growth has helped nurture a crop of local brands, led by Micromax, that outsourced production to Chinese manufacturers. Now, as Samsung rolls out more affordable phones, the same Chinese factories are entering the Indian market with their own brands, depressing prices and forcing Indian mobile makers to rethink their strategies.\\xc2\\xa0\"What the Indian brands did to the global brands two years ago, Chinese phone makers are doing the same to Indian brands now, and over the next year we see tremendous competition for Micromax and other Indian smartphone makers,\" said Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint Research in New Delhi. Micromax, which was founded in New Delhi by four partners in 2000 but only began selling mobile phones in 2008, built its market share by working with Chinese manufacturers such as Coolpad, Gionee and Oppo to offer affordable phones quickly. In 2015, it launched more than 40 new models.\\xc2\\xa0In 2014, the founders brought in outside managers to lead the company at a time when Micromax was challenging Samsung to become the largest mobile phone maker in India.\\xc2\\xa0But tensions arose soon after between founders and the newly hired executives, six former executives told Reuters. These conflicts undermined Micromax\\'s attempts to raise funds for expansion, say former executives. Last May, Alibaba walked away from a mooted $1.2 billion purchase of a 20 percent stake, citing a lack of clarity on growth plans, according to one executive involved in the discussion. Former executives said the lack of fresh funding undermined a proposal by the new executives to move Micromax\\'s research and design operations, which had previously been outsourced, in-house. The move was intended to help Micromax differentiate itself from generic Android clones.\\xc2\\xa0\"We hired about 80-90 people in Bangalore to do in-house software and design, but with no money from the investors and little interest from the founders, that team fizzled away and that office has been partially shut down now,\" said a former executive.\\xc2\\xa0After Alibaba walked away, Micromax struggled to attract other investors who would have been key to Micromax\\'s plan to invest in software R&D and hardware design. The company was forced to scale down the in-house R&D project, a top executive involved in the fundraising plan said. Meanwhile, Chinese handset makers, including Coolpad and Oppo, to which Micromax outsources its manufacturing, were sharpening their focus on India. Samsung, too, began to introduce more affordable models there.\\xc2\\xa0In 2015, Chinese brands doubled their market share to 18 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, taking away business from Indian budget phone makers such as Micromax, Intex, Lava and Karbonn. Indian brands\\' market share fell from 48 to 43 percent last year.',\n",

The attackers used the stolen information to ask the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make massive money transfers -- nearly three dozen of them -- from the Bangladeshi bank\\'s account with the Fed to accounts at other financial institutions overseas.\\xc2\\xa0Four transfers to accounts in the Philippines, totaling abut $80 million, worked. But then a fifth request, for $20 million to be sent to an apparently fictitious Sri Lankan nonprofit, was flagged as suspicious by a routing bank due to the \"fandation\" error.\\xc2\\xa0The Bangladesh central bank was able to stop that transaction after the routing bank asked for confirmation. \"The Sri Lankan bank did not disburse it immediately, and we could recover the full amount,\" the central bank told the Financial Times.\\xc2\\xa0The requests waiting to be processed -- amounting to a total of between $850 million and $870 million, according to an unnamed official cited by Reuters -- were also halted.

Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s returns have been generated by early-stage investments in any given year.\\xc2\\xa0But the value of investing in a company when it is still nascent has been somewhat obscured in recent years as hordes of nontraditional start-up investors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including mutual funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have piled into private tech companies, often when those start-ups are already proven growth stories.

When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too. In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes. First, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitivethan those of many other vocal assistants (like Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers. More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities. Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brain into their own devices, so soon you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need an Echo to consult with Alexa \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.',\n",

On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years. Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure.Google also has a cloud computing office in the area.

As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data.

       " b'FCC cracks down on Verizon Wireless for using \\xe2\\x80\\x98supercookies\\xe2\\x80\\x99: The Federal Communications Commission is cracking down on Verizon Wireless for using a powerful type of code to track its customers around the Internet, as the agency pushes to increase its role in protecting online privacy. The code, dubbed a \"supercookie\" by privacy advocates, is almost impossible to disable and could allow almost anyone to follow users around the Web. Under the terms of a settlement agreement announced Monday, Verizon must pay a $1.35 million fine and will only be able to use the tracking mechanism when users connect to Verizon\\'s corporate family of services unless the company gets customers\\' opt-in consent. Broader use could leave customers\\' Web habits visible to outsiders. Verizon began putting a unique string of characters into customers\\' web browsing in 2012 to help target its advertising program. The practice came to the public\\'s attention in late 2014, when it received criticism from privacy advocates who called the code a \"supercookie\" because the it was almost impossible for users to avoid. The privacy advocates warned then that other companies, or even intelligence agencies, could leverage the super cookies to track wherever people went online. Verizon downplayed that concern at the time, with a spokesperson saying that the code \"wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to be used for that.\" But last January, researcher Jonathan Mayer revealed evidence that others could hijack the supercookie for their own purposes: An online advertising company called Turn was using the codes to help follow people around online, he said. Turn used the supercookie to \"respawn\" its traditional cookies -- even if users took steps to protect their privacy by removing the cookies. Turn said it would stop and Verizon started offering a way for customers to opt-out of having the supercookie attached to their web traffic. But the FCC had already launched an investigation of Verizon\\'s use of supercookies in December of 2014 \\xc2\\xa0-- and later brought Mayer on board as the chief technologist for the agency\\'s enforcement arm. While the Federal Trade Commission is often thought of as the government\\'s primary privacy watch dog, the FCC\\'s power to police online privacy got a major boost last year. As a quirk of how the agency moved to enforce network neutrality rules, broadband providers will be subject to new privacy scrutiny. The FCC is in the process of coming up with a version of its privacy rules that apply to broadband Internet providers, which are expected soon.',\n",

Made-in-Japan Kameyama model TVs, named for the factory, became a hit, and Sharp reaped big profits.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were winners then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yukihiko Nakata, an engineer who worked for 33 years at Sharp.\\xc2\\xa0Those days are over. Sharp is now mired in losses and its future is in doubt. Sharp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plight is a story of missteps by executives who failed to anticipate major shifts in the global electronics industry. China, long the home of cheap manufacturing, has become increasingly sophisticated, making gadgets that can rival Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in quality. Rivals elsewhere are challenging Japanese companies on innovation. The industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s center of power has moved away from Japan to places like China, South Korea and Silicon Valley in the United States.\\xc2\\xa0Sharp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaders were slow to adapt, employees and industry experts say. Unwilling to change strategy when business conditions turned against them, they doubled down on investments in increasingly unprofitable businesses, deepening the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial distress.\\xc2\\xa0As prices of liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, began falling quickly in the mid-2000s, because of advances in manufacturing and a supply glut in China, Sharp scrambled to keep ahead of cheaper competitors. It developed ever-bigger TV displays and expanded into touch screens for smartphones and tablet computers. But rivals matched it more quickly than executives had anticipated, said Mr. Nakata, who left Sharp a decade ago and is now a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan.\\xc2\\xa0Sharp had found a rescuer in a Taiwanese company called Foxconn, which makes gadgets for Apple and others and was offering a $5.5 billion lifeline.

Slack Technologies Inc., which runs a messaging service for businesses, is seeking an investment that would value the company at $3.5 billion to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Slack is looking to raise $150 million to $300 million as part of the round, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren't finalized. The talks are ongoing, and a lead investor has not been selected, the people said. If successful, Slack's fundraising round would stand out. Venture investment in startups dropped about 30 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the previous one, according to research firm CB Insights. Also during the last three months of the year, 26 percent of mature startups raised money at lower valuations than in earlier rounds, according to a study by law firm Fenwick & West LLP. Even as startup fundraising shows signs of slowing and valuations begin to tumble, a few companies are pushing ahead. Slack said it raised $160 million less than a year ago, valuing the company at $2.8 billion. It's raised more than $300 million in total and has also used its fundraising clout to create an $80 million venture fund with several of its investors to back Slack-related apps. Slack, which launched its current business about two years ago, said it has 2.3 million daily active users, up from 520,000 a year ago. The company also said it had more than $64 million in annual recurring revenue. The metric projects the value of current customers over the course of a year, and the number can differ substantially from actual revenue for fast-growing startups.\",\n",

The posting, dated Feb. 23, warned: \"Palantir workers: your common shares are worth $0.00.\"\\xc2\\xa0Palantir staff can relax a bit. The terms of recent fundraising rounds don\\'t contain many of the provisions that can crush the value of common shares held by employees.Fundraising talks last year valued Palantir at $20 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said in June.\\xc2\\xa0While Palantir shares are trading lower on secondary markets than they were last year, the same can be said for many stocks, private and public, thanks to a global economic slowdown. Palantir common stock fetches $8.50 to $10 a share on secondary markets before fees, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private share sales. That\\'s a long way from zero. Palantir declined to comment. Several flyers have already been removed, according to Quartz. Someone posting on an online community forum under the pseudonym Palantir_Watcher claimed responsibility for creating the handouts. The person didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. However, the guerilla campaign tapped into an undercurrent of uncertainty and fear about what private companies in Silicon Valley are worth after a wave ofwritedowns and cost-cutting at startups.\\xc2\\xa0Venture capitalists and other institutional investors typically hold preferred shares. They are worth more on secondary markets than common stock, which is what is given to employees, often representing a significant portion of their compensation. However, Palantir hasn\\'t given newer investors the sort of preferential treatment awarded to shareholders of companies such as DocuSign Inc., Honest Co., and Stripe Inc., according to an analysis by the technology website the Information.\\xc2\\xa0The proportion of funding rounds that gave senior liquidation preferences to new investors was on the rise last year among companies with valuations of at least $1 billion, according to a study by law firm Fenwick & West. That allows those new investors to cash out before common shareholders, as well as earlier investors with preferred shares. During the fourth quarter of 2015, 42 percent of deals had such provisions, compared with 15 percent in the previous two quarters. Investors were also given the right to block an initial public offering that didn\\'t meet their valuation threshold in 33 percent of deals in the fourth quarter, compared with 20 percent in the second quarter, the study said. Palantir had neither provision.',\n",

Reuters has not seen any documents regarding the new information.\\xc2\\xa0The 11th hour delay jeopardizes a deal that would have marked the conclusion to five years of courting by Foxconn founder and billionaire Terry Gou and the opening up of Japan\\'s insular tech sector to foreign investment.\\xc2\\xa0The loss-making display maker said on Thursday that it would issue around $4.4 billion worth of new shares to give Foxconn a two-thirds stake. Foxconn\\'s investment is set to total more than 650 billion yen ($5.8 billion), a separate source familiar with the matter said.\\xc2\\xa0If a deal does go through, it would boost Foxconn\\'s position as Apple\\'s main contract manufacturer and enable Sharp to start mass-producing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens by 2018, around the time Apple is expected to adopt the next-generation displays for its iPhones.\\xc2\\xa0But efforts to patch up the deal could be impeded by lingering distrust over the collapse of the 2012 deal to form capital ties.

The company disclosed the removals in a letter to New York state legislators on Wednesday as it faces criticism over becoming a platform for unregulated hotels. \\xc2\\xa0Airbnb said it kicked off 622 hosts as part of the effort in November. The cuts helped portray a rosier picture of its New York City operations in the data released in December. The company had not outlined the extent of its removals when it initially presented the data publicly. The deleted listings accounted for about 4 percent of those offered in the city. Josh Meltzer, the company\\'s head of public policy in New York, wrote in the letter to legislators that the listings \"did not reflect Airbnb\\'s vision for our community.\" Airbnb has faced questions from city officials who have said real-estate developers are using Airbnb to rent out homes instead of selling them to permanent residents. The practice risks driving up housing prices. Airbnb defeated a proposal in San Francisco last year that would have restricted the company\\'s business in its hometown. Airbnb spent $8 million to fight the effort. \"In New York City, where housing prices and availability are a critical issue, we want to work with our community and policymakers to help prevent short-term rentals from impacting the availability and cost of permanent housing for city residents,\" Meltzer wrote in the letter. \"While home sharing has been around for centuries, our people-to-people home sharing platform is new. And Airbnb is a young company. We have learned that a one-size fits all approach to cities will not work.\" Along with the letter to New York lawmakers, Airbnb released updated data on its operations in the city. Of hosts renting their entire homes in New York City, 38 percent of revenue came from those listing two or more homes on the website. Hosts with six or more homes on Airbnb generated 6 percent of revenue.',\n",

Once the financing closes, it would value the Uber rival at more than $20 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the terms aren't final. The round is oversubscribed, and the company is still negotiating terms with investors, the person said. Didi Kuaidi declined to comment. Didi Kuaidi is spending heavily on adding new drivers and offering competitive fare prices as it aims to stay ahead of Uber Technologies Inc. in China. Uber spent more than $1 billion in the country last year and plans to spend a comparable amount in 2016. In the first three quarters of 2015, Uber lost $1.7 billion, much of that going toward expansion in Asia, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in January. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick said last week that the company is profitable in the U.S., according to Canadian technology blog BetaKit. It's unclear how the metric was calculated. Didi Kuaidi raised $3 billion last year at a $16.5 billion valuation. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the Chinese company's latest fundraising round. To take on Uber, Didi Kuaidi has formed an international coalition with the likes of Lyft Inc. in the U.S. and Ola in India. Uber was last valued by investors at $62.5 billion, and the company has raised more than $10 billion in the five years since it started picking up passengers.\",\n",

The communal kitchen hums with 20-something developers. A gold-painted scooter, which the co-founder William Shu once used to make deliveries, stands in the center of the office as people bustle about.\\xc2\\xa0The frenetic pace belies a more cautious approach that Mr. Shu, 36, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, has recently started taking at the start-up.Over the last year, Mr. Shu has urged colleagues to be more circumspect with growth plans, forgoing rapid expansion in competitive markets like the United States to focus on places where Deliveroo already has a loyal following. And while the start-up has raised almost $200 million, employs roughly 400 people worldwide and operates in 12 countries, Mr. Shu says profitability \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and not just aggressive growth to beat rivals to new markets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is increasingly important as the company moves beyond its British roots. The focus at Deliveroo is symptomatic of a change across many European start-ups. Just as in Silicon Valley, where a number of privately held tech companies have been stung by lower valuations and investor questions about their sustainability, that same unease has now reached Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tech community, in a sign that a move away from soaring boom times in start-ups is going global.\\xc2\\xa0Driving the pullback are some of the same forces that have caused a change in Silicon Valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start-up scene. Tech stocks are gyrating because of fears of a global economic slowdown \\xe2\\x80\\x94 exacerbated in Europe by the region\\xe2\\x80\\x99s migrant crisis and persistent financial problems. Valuations of some start-ups worldwide got ahead of themselves.

Seven of the past 10 technology companies to go public are trading below their offer price, and four are down by at least 20 percent, according to FactSet.\\xc2\\xa0Nutanix, which filed its IPO prospectus in December, is holding off on selling shares until the stock market volatility wanes, said sources familiar with the matter. The developer of data center technology that wraps together storage, servers and virtualization was set to go public in late January, but has been advised by its bankers to wait for the market to calm, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. No other high-profile tech companies are publicly on file. Last month, online lender Elevate Credit delayed its IPO due to market conditions, as January marked the worst month for the Nasdaq since 2010. The index is still down 8.5 percent to start the year even after rallying over the past week. For Silicon Valley\\'s financiers, this is all troubling. Big IPOs are their lifeblood. That\\'s how venture investors make outsized profits and justify the billions of dollars they pour annually into start-ups that ultimately go bust or fail to generate returns.\\xc2\\xa0Last year should have been a banner year for IPOs. The Nasdaq topped 5,000 for the first time since 2000, and rose for the fourth consecutive year. Investors expressed appetite for risk, bidding up Amazon.comand Netflix, the year\\'s two best large-cap performers.\\xc2\\xa0Yet, tech companies went public at the slowest pace since 2009. Instead of IPOs, the highest growth companies were raising mega-rounds of cash in the private market at valuations and revenue multiples that exceeded what public investors were paying. Hedge funds and private equity firms distorted the IPO cycle, putting piles of cash into companies but without rewarding early investors and employees the way public offerings do.\\xc2\\xa0Late-stage private financing almost doubled from $8.9 billion in 2013 to $16 billion last year, according to the National Venture Capital Association, with companies including Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX and SoFi each reeling in at least $1 billion. That could mean a painfully dilutive private investment round, selling the business at a loss to some investors or going public at a price below what earlier investors paid.\\xc2\\xa0\"People just have to get real,\" said Golden, a managing partner at Revolution Ventures in San Francisco and former director of JPMorgan\\'s technology investment banking practice. \"When markets are speaking, we may not like what they\\'re saying but we have to listen.\"',\n",

The fourth quarter was an important one for Etsy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it had to show investors that it could post a strong holiday quarter and bring in new people who would buy gifts and other products on Etsy. It looks like investors were pleased by its ability to beat on revenue and bring in some new buyers and sellers.

Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business. Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level. Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading.

The first three days in the hospital were a blur during which the Costiks, engineers in Rochester, received a crash course in managing the basics of diabetes care.For starters, they were told to log their son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s numbers on paper forms. It was their first hint that diabetes management did not occupy a place on technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bleeding edge. The methods for guesstimating carbohydrate intake also seemed imprecise, Mr. Costik found, and the process generated a lot of wasted data.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe last thing you want to do is find some form and fill it out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really just emotionally trying to cope with it, and that data in that book isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily useful to the people with diabetes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Several months later, Mr. Costik fitted his son with a Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor. A hair-thin sensor under Evan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skin recorded an exact blood sugar reading at five-minute intervals, 24 hours a day.But all that data left with Evan every morning when he headed off to day care. Mr. Costik wanted something better: continuous access to his son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s glucose readings.So he examined the device\\xe2\\x80\\x99s software code and wrote a simple program that transmitted the monitoring data to an online spreadsheet he could view on a Web browser, Android mobile phone or, eventually, his Pebble smartwatch. Now, as consumer gadgets weave themselves ever more tightly into everyday life, patients and their families are finding homespun solutions to problems medical-device manufacturers originally did not address. Industry executives say the pace of user-driven innovation was one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently reclassified remote glucose-monitoring devices, hastening approval for new models by big companies like Dexcom and Medtronics. James Wedding, a civil engineer who lives outside Dallas, saw Mr. Costik\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Twitter post and used his code to set up a remote monitor system for his daughter, Carson, who is now 12. Lane Desborough, an engineer in California, got in touch with Mr. Costik after seeing his tweet, ultimately creating an open-source system based in part on Mr. Costik\\xe2\\x80\\x99s code. It allows anyone to hack existing glucose monitors so they transmit readings to the cloud, where they can be read by patients and caregivers.Mr. Desborough called the project Nightscout. The Nightscout group onFacebook, known as CGM in the Cloud, provides free tech support for users trying to improve on monitoring devices.About two dozen users have even started a project called Open APS, in which they are pairing insulin pumps with glucose monitors in an effort to create an open-source artificial pancreas system. These wearable devices, which automate insulin delivery, are being tested in academic settings, but these early adopters are not waiting for the results of those continuing clinical trials.Mr. Costik now works at the Center for Clinical Innovation at the University of Rochester, where he works to improve management options for all patients; Mr. Desborough is now the chief engineer at Bigfoot Biomedical, a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., that plans to create an artificial pancreas.',\n",

The lackluster guidance overshadowed the company's comfortable quarterly revenue and profit beat in the holiday shopping season. Fitbit has been diversifying its portfolio of colorful wristbands and clippable devices that track calories, sleeping patterns and heart rate, to better compete with rivals as well as to tap new markets and demographies.The company last month unveiled its $200 smartwatch, Blaze, to mixed reviews. Earlier this month, Fitbit announced a new wristband, Alta, to appeal to the more fashion-conscious customer. \\xc2\\xa0Fitbit's net income attributable to common stockholders rose to $64.2 million, or 26 cents per share, in the quarter, from $11.9 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 35 cents per share. Revenue nearly doubled to $711.6 million from $370.2 million.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 25 cents and revenue of $647.8 million. Fitbit's revenue forecast of $2.4 billion-$2.5 billion and adjusted profit of $1.08-$1.20 per share for 2016 was largely in line with expectations.Shares of the San Francisco-based company were down 15 percent at $14.04 in after-hours trading on Monday after closing up 5.9 percent.The stock, which has lost nearly 70 percent of its value since hitting a high in August, has been trading below the June IPO price of $20 all this month.\",\n",

The benefit of getting more people to sign up for Prime services -- for $99 a year -- is that they tend to shop more frequently and spend more money, while access to other perks such as online movies, music and other content helps to keep customers within Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shopping ecosystem. By encouraging non-Prime customers to spend more on a single order, Seattle-based Amazon is also aiming to reduce costs while boosting profits on each sale. The new threshold follows a 33 percent jump in fulfillment costs -- warehousing, packaging and shipping -- in the fourth quarter, which outpaced a 15 percent increase in product sales. Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price increase is the first since 2013, when Amazon raised the threshold to $35 from $25.

       " b'New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Online Content:\\xc2\\xa0China is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval. The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video. The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval. China already has some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years. One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.',\n",
       " b'Apple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly:\\xc2\\xa0In Silicon Valley \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if not Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief executive, emphasized on Tuesday in a letter to customers that helping the F.B.I. essentially hack into one of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own phones would be a dangerous precedent. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, Apple said it would have to create new software to do this. But while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud. That may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology. ICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed. Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation and its resistance is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnically able.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIn the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.',\n",

Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook (which, in case if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve forgotten, is the parent company of Oculus) will be bringing its dynamic streaming technology for 360 video to Gear VR (which, in case if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve forgotten, is powered by Oculus). This technology allows significant performance upgrades to streaming content by only playing back what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in view of the headset at any given time rather than processing the entire 360 sphere of video at once. All of this is done by seamlessly switching between dozens of variants of each 360 video taken from multiple angles. Facebook revealed more about the technology at its Video @Scale event last month. The results speak for themselves, Facebook says their efforts have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquadrupled the resolution quality of 360 streaming video in VR by reducing the amount of required network bandwidth by 4x.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another interesting tidbit comes from a Facebook blog post today\\xe2\\x80\\x94they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a social VR team to focus \\xe2\\x80\\x9centirely on exploring the future of social interaction in VR.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

The launch of the auction process, a move activist hedge fund Starboard Value and other shareholders have pushed since late last year, showed the company was moving another step closer to selling its core business, which includes search, mail and news sites, rather than spin it off as previously planned. The move follows more than three years of effort by CEO Marissa Mayer to turn around Yahoo by focusing on mobile apps and trying to boost advertising revenue. \\xc2\\xa0Yahoo had acknowledged during its earnings last month that it was open to exploring options for its core business. Despite the launch, Starboard's founder Jeffrey Smith is not backing down, and will continue his pursuit of nominating a group of directors for the Yahoo board, people familiar with the matter said.\",\n",

The start-up has created a glove that steadies a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand, making it easier to complete everyday tasks such as eating. The glove\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power lies in a bronze disc on the back of the hand, which weighs about as much as a roll of nickels. It spins at up to 20,000 rotations per minute, providing a steadying force. The force of the battery-powered disc is akin to putting one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand in molasses. While moving is not as easy, the benefit is that much of the shaking is naturally filtered out. GyroGear is aiming to reduce tremors by 70 percent. In one lab test, the London-based researchers say, it reduced a tremor by 90 percent. GyroGear founder Faii Ong was inspired by a 103-year-old hospital patient who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat without spilling food. While cleaning her up, the medical student at Imperial College started to brainstorm solutions. \\xc2\\xa0Ong cautions that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still work to be done. The glove hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been tested by outside parties, but they plan to publish their findings in a peer-reviewed journal by the end of the year. They also hope to begin selling the product by year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end and are raising funds from investors. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe idea of simple, wearable devices to treat tremor and to avoid the side effects from medications or alternatively the dangers of surgery is very appealing to patients and health care providers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael S. Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe GyroGlove is an interesting idea, however many of these types of devices fall short of the expectations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially when faced with very severe and disabling tremor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There are other efforts to use mechanical solutions to aid those with Parkinson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease. Lift Labs, a start-up that Google acquired in 2014, has devised a vibrating spoon and fork to counteract tremors and make eating easier. While having shown promise for mild tremors, Okun said it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t proven the most effective solution for more severe cases. In the long term GyroGear is interested in adapting its glove to other uses, such as for surgeons, physical therapists, photographers or anyone seeking to keep a steady hand.',\n",

       " b'Facebook Plans To Put Ads In Messenger:\\xc2\\xa0A leaked document Facebook sent to some of its biggest advertisers reveals that Facebook will launch ads within Messenger in Q2 2016. The document, obtained by TechCrunch but kept private to protect its verified source, says businesses will be able to send ads as messages to people who previously initiated a chat thread with that company. To prepare, the document recommends that businesses get consumers to start message threads with them now so they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to send them ads when the feature launches. The document also notes that Facebook has quietly launched a URL short link fb.com/msg/ that instantly opens a chat thread with a business. Facebook confirmed the existence of the URL short link. That seems to back up the validity of the leaked document. Messenger is one of Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most popular and fastest-growing products, with 800 million monthly active users. Yet the social network has never monetized it directly before. Thankfully for users, Facebook isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to let brands send ad messages to just anyone or even people who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve liked their Pages. Only those who have voluntarily chatted with a business can be sent ads. This should somewhat limit the spam potential and annoyance. Right now, almost all messages come from one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends, so Facebook will likely try to preserve this high signal-to-noise ratio with limits on advertising.',\n",
       " b'Secondary Shops Flooded With Unicorn Sellers:\\xc2\\xa0Until recently, shares of some of the highest-flying unicorn companies have been so hard to come by that secondary buyers have battled each other, not to mention other investors, to acquire some of the startups\\xe2\\x80\\x99 common shares. As the fortunes of billion-dollar companies like Evernote have fizzled, however, so has their shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 enthusiasm. Says the cofounder of one secondary shop who asked not to be named, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seeing huge discounts yet in the top 10 names, but people are trying to dump them. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just one person calling you about a particular company. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Says another secondary investor, who also asked not to be identified for this story, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing an enormous uptick in inbound selling interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The situation is changing so quickly that several people with whom we spoke say a number of new characters are now peddling shares of so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA List\\xe2\\x80\\x9d companies whose shares would have been beyond nearly anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reach six months ago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing a lot of sketchy people advertising these deals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says one insider. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used to be like this. Just a year ago, demand for unicorn stock was at an unprecedented level, as were the number of companies establishing billion-dollar valuations for themselves. Unicorn coverage became a cottage industry unto itself, with tech outlets and even data analysis firms poring over which unicorns were the best employers, which companies were positioned to become unicorns, and which venture firms were the best at spotting unicorns early on, among other angles. Alas, by late August, China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market was in a nose-drive, and both late-and early-stage investors began applying the brakes. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t long before non-traditional venture investors like Fidelity and Blackrock were slashing the valuations of some of the startups in the portfolio. A parade of well-reported WSJ pieces about what isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite right at high-flying Theranos seemed to cement what many had started to think: That many unicorns really weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worth what their ambitious investors had settled on. (It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help when, last week, the human resources startup Zenefits asked its CEO to resign over sloppy and possibly damning business practices. Ten months ago, the company was valued at $4.5 billion by investors.) Partly, such nervousness owes to employees, some of whom are getting laid off as companies cut back on costs in order to lengthen their runway. These former staffers have to exercise their options within 90 days or else lose them, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling secondary firms for help in figuring out what to do. Some sellers are venture capital firms that thought they could exit some of their investments in 2016 and are now concluding that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. (As some readers will know, the clock is always ticking on a venture fund. Most have 10 or 11 years, tops, to invest in startups and get some cash back to investors before losing the confidence of those backers.)',\n",

He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just announced the $22 billion purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service and was touting an initiative called Internet.org, a low-bandwidth suite of basic services carriers would offer in conjunction with Facebook to get hundreds of millions of people online for the first time. He pledged to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuild what is going to be a more profitable model with more subscribers for carriers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d By sticking together, the Facebook founder said, both sides could benefit handsomely.As Zuckerberg prepares to return to Barcelona for this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MWC on Feb. 22, phone executives say his company looks more like a competitor than a partner. Last year, WhatsApp introduced free voice calls\\xe2\\x80\\x94something Facebook already offered\\xe2\\x80\\x94and both brands have messaging apps. These so-called over-the-top services cut into mobile carriers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 voice and texting revenue because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re offered over the Internet. Some phone companies say Facebook and its ilk are freeloaders that rely on carriers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 network infrastructure without spending any money to support it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatsApp is competing with us, not only with messaging but with voice, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Telef\\xc3\\xb3nica Chief Operating Officer Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Mar\\xc3\\xada \\xc3\\x81lvarez-Pallete said in August at a telecommunications industry event in the Spanish coastal city of Santander. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe premise should be, same services, same rules.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Not all carriers are lining up against Facebook. The company has more than a dozen partnerships with phone companies from Paraguay to the Philippines. Many of them say teaming up with Facebook is beneficial, because it boosts data usage and has the potential to increase revenue. Millicom International Cellular, a carrier with more than 63 million subscribers in Africa and Latin America, has run promotions in certain markets where it offers free access to Facebook and Internet.org for a couple of months. The company reported last year that 33 percent of subscribers who take part end up upgrading to fee-paying data plans. Similarly, South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s No. 3 mobile company, Cell C, offers Facebook and WhatsApp for free in certain subscription packages, because they draw new users. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t innovate around these services and drive value to our customers, we run a higher risk of being left out of the future entirely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Cell C Chief Executive Officer Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Dos Santos in an e-mail. In the long run, say some industry analysts, WhatsApp and other alternatives shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be seen as a threat to the voice service of phone companies. The typically superior sound quality of the voice calls in the apps uses lots of data. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf carriers price their data offerings correctly, it could drive up revenues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says John Delaney, an analyst at researcher IDC. And when people graduate to video apps like Skype, data consumption grows exponentially. Says Delaney, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat carriers resent is investing heavily and having others piggyback on their investments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " b'Scientists created a three-armed cyborg to play the drums like no human can:\\xc2\\xa0Georgia Tech researchers have built a robotic arm that attaches to a drummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulder and plays along. This allows drummers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 now equipped with three arms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to play sequences that two-armed humans can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even attempt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a richer and more sophisticated rhythm because you can hit one more thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gil Weinberg, director of the Center for Music Technology at Georgia Tech. The robotic arm is capable of hitting a drum up to 20 times per second, a rate that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible for humans. And it never needs a break. The computerized arm listens to the sound of the human playing and improvises to accompany the beat. Currently it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be programmed to play specific songs. The robotic arm will generally mirror the volume and speed that the human is playing. Weinberg stopped short of saying the three-armed solution is presently better than what a drummer can do with two hands. The arm, finalized last week, hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been tested yet to see how it complements professional drummers. Weinberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next step is having drummers wear a brain-scanning headband, and see whether the robotic arm can interpret their intentions and play exactly what they desire. Since 2006, he has worked to create memorable music through artificial intelligence. In one project, Weinberg built a robotic prosthesis for a drummer who lost an arm in an accident.',\n",
       " b'Zenefits Scandal Highlights Perils of Hypergrowth at Start-Ups:\\xc2\\xa0Zenefits may be among the first of several cautionary tales to highlight a sobering lesson: For a start-up, growing too quickly can produce just as spectacular a failure as growing too slowly. Zenefits is a three-year-old company that makes software for small businesses. In its short life span, it has been called both the most unsexy company in tech, and one of the most promising.Its investors have argued that Zenefits, which makes money by acting as a health-insurance brokerage firm for its customers, has the potential to cut the red tape that small businesses have to battle to provide benefits for their employees.These grand promises were bolstered by Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 early growth. Its annual recurring revenue \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an accounting measure preferred by subscription-based software companies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reached $1 million by the end of 2013, the year Zenefits was founded. Recurring revenue hit $20 million by late 2014, and was projected to reach $100 million by late 2015. The exponential growth was catnip to investors. The start-up raised $500 million last year at a $4 billion valuation, one of the largest financing rounds in a year of mega-fundings. At one point, Andreessen Horowitz, Silicon Valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-eminent venture firm, had invested more in Zenefits than in any other company. In total, Zenefits has raised about $581 million. Then, last week, poof. Zenefits announced that Parker Conrad, its co-founder and chief executive, had resigned. In emails to employees, David O. Sacks, the former chief operating officer and new chief executive, explained that Mr. Conrad had overseen a company that had become derelict in its culture and ethics. Zenefits has sought to paint the executive changes as a new beginning. One person close to the company said when Mr. Sacks briefed employees on Mr. Conrad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exit last week, there were celebrations and tears of relief at the San Francisco headquarters of Zenefits. \\xc2\\xa0Yet the story is more complicated than the single instance of a founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misdeeds. Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 recklessness seems to have been merely the worst symptom of a larger sickness that infected the company, according to investors, former employees and others who worked with the management team (and who all requested anonymity because no one in Silicon Valley wants to be seen as kicking a start-up when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down). \\xc2\\xa0That sickness: Zenefits was a company consumed by impossible expectations. In return for fund-raising at a stratospheric value, Mr. Conrad promised the moon to investors.\\xc2\\xa0Then, to reach the moon, he began to transform a tiny start-up into a mighty rocket ship \\xe2\\x80\\x94 only to watch it careen out of control as it stretched to accomplish the impossible. Though many noticed trouble, neither Mr. Conrad, nor the board of directors, nor anyone else in management could afford to stop, take a breath and fix the problems.

In a pinch \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or in a war \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sailors need something to fall back on. And stars and sextants have been working pretty well for hundreds of years. So the Naval Academy started teaching its sailors how to navigate ships by looking to the heavens again this academic year. The training was dropped altogether in 2006. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought that we had computers and all that for navigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hogan, 20, a Charleston, S.C., native said this week during a class on the subject. But amid concerns about cyberattacks and new weapons that can shut off the electricity of a ship or a plane, the Naval Academy made celestial navigation a requirement for third-year students. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRedundancy is the best policy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lt. Alex Reardon, who taught three sections of the class. Especially because, when it comes to a Navy ship on the open seas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re typically alone in what we do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That could be a major problem in the event of a cyberattack, said Salvatore Mercogliano, an assistant professor focused on naval history at Campbell University and a former merchant mariner. During World War II, the U.S. began using land-based radio beacons known as the LORAN system to help guide ships. And the space race helped further celestial navigation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decline: The Navy sponsored the development of the first operational satellite navigation system, dubbed TRANSIT, which went into active service in 1964 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 providing navigation assistance for naval submarines and surface vessels.

But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe to say that augmented reality is coming into a new phase: The contextual information being supplied is getting smarter, and people are gradually becoming more aware of the capabilities of AR and virtual reality (some are even excited to wear headsets, if you can believe it). So Blippar, in an effort to evolve along with the rest of the AR world, has just launched a new version of its smartphone app that is supposed to recognize literally any object you point at it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether it has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctagged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with an AR code or not.\\xc2\\xa0Blippar co-founder and CEO Ambarish Mitra showed off the new version of the mobile app today at the Code/Media conference at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel in Dana Point, Calif. He pointed the app at a variety of random objects \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a magazine, a salad and an apple \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to demonstrate how the app\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image recognition capabilities work.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a really big change in our business model,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mitra had said in an interview before the conference kicked off. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInitially, AR was about very static image recognition. You store images of Starbucks or Coca-Cola or General Mills in our database, and the images match. But now you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re able to analyze any environment in the world in real time, over a 3G connection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Mitra said over the past year and a half he has moved his technology team from the U.K. to Mountain View, Calif., to focus on machine learning, which is all the rage in Silicon Valley right now, with everyone from small upstarts to behemoths like Google trying to crack the code on how to make accurate predictions from large sets of data. (Google, actually, has an app that works similarly called Google Goggles, but it works when you point the app at a QR code or a famous landmark or something else recognizable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not necessarily everyday objects.)\\xc2\\xa0In short, this is not an easy thing to do. In fact, ahead of the event, one of our staffers tried it out by pointing the app at his dog, and it thought the pup was a goat.\\xc2\\xa0Mitra has said that, right now, the technology has elementary capabilities, like the brain of a six-year-old; it can recognize \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrius,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or it can recognize an item of clothing, but not the label. However, with machine learning, the app should be able to get to the level of an 18-year-old pretty quickly, Mitra said, in terms of its recognition abilities. And during the onstage demo, it did properly identify a pug named Milton as a dog.',\n",
       " b'Virtual Reality Companies Look to Science Fiction for Their Next Play:\\xc2\\xa0Tech companies have spent years developing better, cheaper devices to immerse people in digital worlds. Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without. So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction. At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReady Player One\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStar Trek.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike many other people working in the tech space, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a creative person,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Palmer Luckey, 23, a co-founder of Oculus, which was bought by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice that science fiction exists because these are really creative people figuring out what the ultimate use of any technology might be. They come up with a lot of incredible ideas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Those ideas are especially relevant now, as some of the biggest technology companies are nearing a major push of a new generation of virtual reality products. In the next few months, virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and HTC go on sale. Venture capital money is pouring into the industry. But how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cScience fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses. Techies do not need any encouragement from their employers to read or watch science fiction, long a pillar of geek culture. The genre has influenced many corners of technology, from smartphones to robotics to space exploration. But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and often someone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters. Magic Leap, based in Dania Beach, Fla., and which counts Google as one of its big investors, has gone even further than most companies by hiring three science fiction and fantasy writers on staff. Its most famous sci-fi recruit is Neal Stephenson, who depicted the virtual world of the Metaverse in his seminal 1992 novel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSnow Crash.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In an interview, Mr. Stephenson \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose title is chief futurist \\xe2\\x80\\x94 declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontent projects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d underway at the company.',\n",

Apparently, one of the best ways to get a reply is to write as if you're 9 years old. That's according to the makers of the Boomerang mail plug-in, who found that writing at a third-grade reading level seems to be the right level of complexity for the average message, after mining their user data for information on what kind of writing actually gets replies. Here's a full list of the tips from the makers of Boomerang: Use shorter sentences with simpler words. A 3rd grade reading level works best. Include 1-3 questions in your email. Make sure you include a subject line! Aim for 3-4 words. Use a slightly positive or slightly negative tone. Both outperform a completely neutral tone. Take a stand! Opinionated messages see higher response rates than objective ones. Write enough, but not too much. Try to keep messages between 50-125 words.\",\n",

But that does not necessarily apply to tweets, according to a study released this week. In fact, it is difficult to predict the outcome of an election based on the amount of Twitter buzz a candidate gets, according to the study from the Social Science Computer Review. The study, whose relevance to this year\\'s U.S. election was sharply disputed by Twitter, focused on the 2013 German federal election and found that Twitter data was a more accurate measure of the level of interest in candidates rather than the level of support they will receive. The daily volume of Twitter messages referring to candidates or parties fluctuates heavily depending on the events of the day - such as televised leaders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 debates, high-profile interviews with candidates - or the coverage of political controversies and scandals,\" the study said. The data also showed that Twitter users did not necessarily reflect the demographics of the population as a whole. In the United States, social media platforms like Twitter and Yik Yak are often more popular among millennial voters. A Twitter spokesman argued the study was not relevant to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \"I\\'d advise passing the next time someone sends along German Twitter data from three years ago in the context of the 2016 U.S. election,\" said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for the social media site\\'s government and news department. Pacilio cited a Time magazine website report that showed Twitter chatter favored the winning candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, in the Iowa caucuses this month.',\n",
       " b'After Zenefits, Will VCs Rein in Their Unicorns? The $4.5 billion benefits startup moved fast and broke things\\xe2\\x80\\x94maybe even the law:\\xc2\\xa0In a Feb. 1 meeting at its blandly luxurious Sand Hill Road offices, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz urged the chief executive officer of one of its most prized and promising companies to resign. Zenefits makes software designed to simplify and automate such HR tasks as health insurance signups. At three years old, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s valued at $4.5 billion and is one of the fastest-growing business software companies ever. Under founding CEO Parker Conrad, it also made software that allowed its employees to skirt state regulatory requirements, the company now admits. Days after Chief Operating Officer David Sacks gave that information to Lars Dalgaard, an Andreessen partner who sits on Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 board, Conrad was out, say three people familiar with the matter. At Conrad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion, they replaced him with Sacks, a Silicon Valley fixture who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worked at Microsoft and co-founded Yammer, the business chat company. In Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 early days, the people say, Conrad created a deceptive program called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Macro,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which made it look like employees were watching legally mandated online training when they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Workers who claimed to have completed the training may have been well short of the required 52 hours. Conrad used it himself, the people say. California regulators are investigating Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use of the Macro, as well as whether its employees had licenses when they started selling insurance. On Feb. 8, Sacks announced Conrad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resignation in an internal e-mail. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor us, compliance is like oxygen. Without it, we die,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sacks wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany of our internal processes, controls, and actions around compliance have been inadequate, and some decisions have just been plain wrong. As a result, Parker has resigned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Conrad declined to comment. Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial issues were discussed during the Feb. 1 board meeting. Andreessen co-founder Ben Horowitz, who isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a Zenefits director, attended. But two people close to the post-Conrad Zenefits say the Macro, not sales misses, was responsible for the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resignation. At the meeting, Conrad tentatively agreed to resign, relinquish his board seat, and make Sacks CEO, say three people close to the company. People close to Conrad now say he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agitated by how Sacks\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very public letters to employees have characterized his departure and blamed him for Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compliance problems. The accusations that unlicensed Zenefits brokers were selling insurance became public on Nov. 25 when BuzzFeed reporter Will Alden began publishing articles on the matter. California and Washington state are investigating Zenefits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sales. The company says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperating with those probes and conducting its own, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hired PricewaterhouseCoopers for a third-party assessment. Sacks declined to comment. Two people close to Sacks say he first began to worry about the Macro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible criminal implications in late January, after receiving new information from the internal investigation. To verify that an insurance sales applicant has completed the 52 hours of training, California requires a signature that carries a perjury charge if violated.',\n",

But Project Loon almost didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it. Google struggled to find a balloon design that could be inexpensive and durable enough to not only float but navigate to predictably travel through the stratosphere. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe busted a lot of balloons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Astro Teller, head of Alphabet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s X unit (formerly Google X), showing off some of the designs to the crowd at the annual TED conference, which kicked off Monday in Vancouver. There were shiny balloons and round balloons and balloons that looked like giant pillows. But eventually the company found a design that could be made cheaply and still navigate precisely. That balloon, Teller said, last year travelled around the world 19 times over 187 days. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo we are going to keep going,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Teller said, noting that what was once a slow connection has advanced enough to deliver about 15 megabits-per-second Internet access, which he pointed out is enough to deliver video \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as a live broadcast of his TED talk. The next step will be seeing how it works delivering real Internet service to consumers. In addition to Indonesia, Alphabet has reached a deal with the Sri Lankan government to exchange access to needed radio frequency spectrum for a stake in the project. Alphabet is in talks with carriers around the world, Teller said, adding that the prospect is very real and that a further five billion people will have Internet access within five to 10 years. On the TED stage, Teller also talked about two moonshots that Google abandoned. The first, he said, was vertical farming, which would have used one-tenth the water and one one-hundreth of the land demanded by traditional agriculture. But although Google grew some lettuce, it never managed to grow staple crops like grain or rice. Another effort would have allowed landlocked countries to ship goods far more cheaply using a rocket-like air cargo ship that could land without a runway. The idea itself might have worked, Teller said, but just building the first unit would have cost $200 million. Even for a company with Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s riches, that proved too much to gamble. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there is an Achilles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heel in one of our projects, we want to know it right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Teller said.',\n",

The idea isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just to print an object and be done, however \\xe2\\x80\\x93 instead, kids will print parts that can be assembled to form larger creations, like dolls, robots, dinosaurs, scorpions, skeletons, bracelets or necklaces, for example. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting here is the potential for Mattel to tie into other children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x99 brands it already owns or licenses and bring them to life through 3D printing. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something the company says is on the roadmap, saying it will launch \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadditional design content, including branded options\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at a later date. No actual brand names were announced, however, but there were hints that brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels were already being planned. The physical parts are printed in batches then assembled through ball-and-socket joints that snap together. This process can take anywhere from 30 minutes for a small item, up to overnight (e.g. 6 6 to 8 hours) for a larger toy.Mattel says its ThingMaker 3D will use a hard PLA filament, but also hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet announced the colors that will be available.

A new design science is emerging in the pursuit of building what are called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconversational agents,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d software programs that understand natural language and speech and can respond to human voice commands. However, the creation of such systems, led by researchers in a field known as human-computer interaction design, is still as much an art as it is a science. It is not yet possible to create a computerized voice that is indistinguishable from a human one for anything longer than short phrases that might be used for weather forecasts or communicating driving directions.Most software designers acknowledge that they are still faced with crossing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuncanny valley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which voices that are almost human-sounding are actually disturbing or jarring. The phrase was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. He observed that as graphical animations became more humanlike, there was a point at which they would become creepy and weird before improving to become indistinguishable from videos of humans. Beyond correct pronunciation, there is the even larger challenge of correctly placing human qualities like inflection and emotion into speech. Linguists call this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprosody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ability to add correct stress, intonation or sentiment to spoken language. Today, even with all the progress, it is not possible to completely represent rich emotions in human speech via artificial intelligence.

But the rise of artificial intelligence and connected computers in everything from toasters to implanted medical device could dramatically raise the stakes of digital security. In fact, they topped a long list of \"global threats\" that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper unveiled Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services committee. \"The Internet of Things will connect tens of billions of new physical devices that could be exploited,\" Clapper wrote in his Senate testimony. \"Artificial intelligence will enable computers to make autonomous decisions\" that hackers could disrupt to cause chaos. For the nation\\'s spy chief to place those threats so high on his list is a big deal, and it reflects how deeply concerned the intelligence community is about the potential pitfalls of these technologies. But Clapper also found a silver lining, writing in his assessment that the technology can \"also create new opportunities for our own intelligence collectors.\" In other words, you can expect America\\'s intelligence community to use driverless cars, smart thermostats and automated networks for spying purposes, too. And indeed, in the written assessment Clapper notes that \"intelligence services might use the IoT for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\" in the future. Back in 2013, for example, the Federal Trade Commission cracked down on a company that sold web-connected cameras. The privacy watchdog alleged that faulty software packaged with the devices, which were marketed as secure, left private video feeds exposed online, eventually allowing hackers to share links to live streams from 700 customers\\' homes online. More alarming is the potential for people to be able exploit devices to cause lethal results, from medical equipment to cars. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration warned hospitals not to use one kind of drug pump after researchers uncovered a flaw that \"could allow an unauthorized user to control the device and change the dosage the pump delivers, which could lead to over- or under-infusion of critical patient therapies.\"',\n",

Samsung won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be working with Apple for the next iPhone. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an overnight change as Apple has already been working with TSMC in the past. The A9 chips in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are currently manufactured by both TSMC and Samsung. Before that, TSMC was the sole supplier of the A8 for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Using multiple manufacturing partners provide different advantages. First, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good way to make sure that you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any supply shortage. Given that Apple sells tens of millions of iPhones per quarter, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear whether Samsung alone or TSMC alone can manufacture enough chips for all these phones. Samsung and TSMC also manufacture chips for other phones as well. Second, negotiating with multiple companies lets you get better prices. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear whether Samsung is more expensive than TSMC, but Apple can drive the prices down as the A10 represents a huge contract. Finally, Apple can pick the most efficient design. TSMC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A9 was slightly better when it comes to battery life. So Apple might favor TSMC for this reason as well. According to The Electronic Times, TSMC should start production of the A10 in June ahead of the iPhone 7 release this Fall. It could feature a 10nm design. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to wait for an iPhone 7 teardown to learn more about the A10. For the end customer, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change much if your iPhone chip is manufactured by TSMC or Samsung. Both companies implement Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own CPU design.

Some had rated LinkedIn a buy a few hours before its downgraded forecast. They watched in horror as its stock fell more than 40 percent, bottoming out below $104 on Feb. 5. Some put it more simply than others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bob Peck wrote in a Feb. 5 note downgrading the stock to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneutral.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d praised LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s odds of continued progress two weeks earlier.) Mizuho Securities lamented the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificantly slower\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growth prospects, while James Cakmak at Monness Crespi Hardt said he was no longer sure even LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slower growth would be sustainable. LinkedIn took a beating even though its earnings report was consistent with recent performance. As usual, it beat earnings expectations, then issued a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the year. It delivered a similarly disappointing projection in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second quarter, at which point its stock dipped 19 percent. But now Wall Street is more skeptical of the tech stocks it once assumed would grow forever. Until Feb. 5, LinkedIn looked like an ideal tech stock to own, almost like a combination of Facebook and Salesforce.com. A free network for professionals, it has the ingredients to grow virally, like a social media company. It sells services to recruiters, salespeople, and marketers, giving it several ways to snag recurring revenue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was considered one of the preeminent names, like Facebook and Google,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Peck. Now reality is setting in, and to expand, LinkedIn has to do more difficult and expensive things, like developing and selling more product lines. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen companies hit these growth walls, people just react really strongly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Lemkin. Walls are springing up all over. On its earnings call, LinkedIn announced it had shut down Sales Accelerator, a software tool designed to connect businesses with potential customers, because of a lack of interest. Analysts had said the feature would be worth millions. LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall user growth slowed, it got tougher to hold on to paid users, and the company had to lean harder on its sales staff. Small factors added up, and analysts were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblindsided,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Monness Crespi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cakmak.',\n",
       " b'Delivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market:\\xc2\\xa0DoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always stick around. Mr. Navarro began driving for DoorDash and another delivery start-up, Postmates, in Los Angeles about four months ago. Mr. Navarro, 40, who previously drove for the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, said he had seen plenty of contractors quit DoorDash and other delivery companies during the time he has worked with them. The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm. But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy. Good Eggs, an organic grocery delivery service, laid off more than 100 employees and shuttered its offices outside its San Francisco headquarters in August. Instacart, the grocery delivery service, recently laid off 12 recruiters, which the company said was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpart of an overall plan to slow down hiring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after a growth spree last year. And DoorDash has been turned down by some venture capitalists as it has tried to raise new financing, according to three people familiar with the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plans. The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users. As DoorDash\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups\\xe2\\x80\\x99 costs don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.',\n",

       " b'The Difference Between Facebook and Twitter:\\xc2\\xa0Twitter Is Lonely for New Users: The simplest reason Facebook has built a massive gap between the two companies over the past three years is that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel alone on Facebook. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to find connections because everyone you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever met and their mother is already on the social network. (Seriously, all my friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moms have Facebook accounts.) Posting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t intimidating because you know who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to see it (your approved friends), and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re almost always guaranteed some kind of feedback on what you share. It may be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpity Like\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from your cousin or your college roommate, but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall ever seeing a Facebook post that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have at least one like or comment. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care who you are, social validation feels good. Twitter, on the other hand, is lonely, especially for new users. Unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a politician or a celebrity, signing up for Twitter probably means spending your first few days on the service (if not weeks or months) with close to zero followers. Tweeting into a black hole is not fun. Finding relevant conversations is not easy, and venturing into strangers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 conversations takes courage. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still too hard to find people to follow when you first sign up on Twitter. The company has made it easier to follow celebrities and media organizations you might want to hear from, but finding people you might actually interact with is a massive challenge the company still hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figured out. I see engagement-less tweets all the time. These things hurt Twitter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth because they push people away before they ever see benefit from the platform. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why, as of two years ago, nearly a billion people had signed up for Twitter, most of whom never stuck around. (The numbers of deserters is probably much higher today.) The easiest way to fix this problem is to fix Twitter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feed, which does a great job funneling in a constant stream of live updates and a horrible job helping your tweets get seen. I have 11,000 followers, people I assume follow me because they want to see what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tweeting. I tweeted 22 times last week, and my tweets were seen, on average, 3,500 times apiece. (This includes one super-popular tweet that got lots of views thanks to a retweet from an NFL player with a big following.)',\n",

While the number was up 9 percent from a year ago, when monthly active users stood at 288 million, the figures showed that Mr. Dorsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent moves have made little impact in attracting users. The user figures overshadowed otherwise positive fourth-quarter earnings results. Twitter reported revenue of $710 million, up 48 percent from $479 million a year ago. Net loss narrowed to $90.2 million, or 13 cents a share, from a loss of $125 million, or 20 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.

Tesla shares rose despite a wider fourth-quarter net loss of $2.44 a share, compared with a loss of 86 cents a share a year earlier. Tesla reported an adjusted loss of 87 cents per share in the fourth quarter, while analysts expected a profit of 10 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

He said the company was simply looking to supplement its delivery partners -- not replace them -- during peak periods like the Christmas shopping season. Amazon documents reviewed by Bloomberg News reveal a far bolder plan.A 2013 report to Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior management team proposed an aggressive global expansion of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fulfillment By Amazon service, which provides storage, packing and shipping for independent merchants selling products on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website. The report envisioned a global delivery network that controls the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in Atlanta, New York and London. The project, called Dragon Boat, is proceeding, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t public. The ambitious strategy promises to turn FedEx and UPS into Amazon rivals, but also will pit the Seattle giant against Chinese counterpart Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Both companies are vying for dominance of the rapidly growing cross-border e-commerce market, which by 2020 is expected to swell into a $1 trillion industry serving 900 million shoppers, according to a June report from Accenture and AliResearch, Alibaba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research arm. Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan would culminate with the launch of a new venture called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlobal Supply Chain by Amazon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as soon as this year, the documents said. The new business will locate Amazon at the center of a logistics industry that involves not just shippers like FedEx and UPS but also legions of middlemen who handle cargo and paperwork associated with transnational trade. Amazon wants to bypass these brokers, amassing inventory from thousands of merchants around the world and then buying space on trucks, planes and ships at reduced rates. Merchants will be able to book cargo space online or via mobile devices, creating what Amazon described as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone click-ship for seamless international trade and shipping.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

On Tuesday, the federal agency that sets road rules \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 released a letter to the Internet giant that supports its interpretation of a driverless system as legally adequate for roadways, a key victory for the critical initiative within Alphabet, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parent company.

That effort hit a major roadblock on Monday, when Indian regulators banned free mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others. The regulations, issued after months of intense public debate over how to extend the Internet to India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poorest citizens, effectively block Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controversial Free Basics program in the country. Free Basics offers people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the Facebook social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. Facebook describes the program as a way to introduce the poor and the technologically unskilled to the potential of the Internet. Free Basics came out of Mr. Zuckerberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program for universal Internet access, which was started in 2013 under an initiative called Internet.org. The idea was to simplify phone applications to run more efficiently and to offer these apps to users in developing countries. Half a dozen of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, agreed to work with Facebook as partners on the initiative. Free Basics is now in 38 countries, from Indonesia to Panama. Facebook is investing heavily in other parts of the project, including experiments to deliver cheap Wi-Fi to remote villages and to beam Internet service from high-flying drones. In India, where Facebook already has at least 132 million users, the company began offering Free Basics last year through Reliance Communications, a local mobile phone carrier. A Reliance spokesman could not be reached for comment. The program quickly became the target of critics, who said that it was an attempt to steer unsophisticated new Internet users to Facebook and other services that were working with the company. They argued that Free Basics and other so-called zero rating programs, which are a set of apps or sites that a mobile operator or I.S.P. does not charge customers to use, violated the concept of net neutrality. Facebook embarked on a blitz of paid lobbying and advertising to promote Free Basics, spending millions of dollars in media campaigns to convince locals its offering would be positive for the population. The company ran special banners in the Facebook news feeds of Indian users urging them to petition the government to allow Free Basics. Mr. Zuckerberg personally lobbied against the new rules, including writing an opinion column in The Times of India. Experts said that campaign may have had an adverse effect on Indian thinking.

He forecast a profit by early 2017. \"The conversation had really changed from a year ago,\" he said. Hired faces many larger and more established competitors. CareerBuilder.com, Indeed Inc., LinkedIn Corp., and Monster Worldwide Inc. each control segments of the online jobs market. Monster generated revenue of $770 million in 2014. Although LinkedIn had a rough time last week, the site generated $862 million in just its last quarter. Hired said it has a 2016 revenue \"run rate\" of $100 million. (The number is generally calculated by using the performance during one period as the basis to project a full year.) Hired is cost-free for job seekers, who create profiles listing their skills and backgrounds. About 4 percent of applicants are accepted. Recruiters from companies such as American Express Co., Comcast Corp., and Facebook Inc., pay to target those high-skill candidates and send them offers via e-mail. Since it began in 2012, Hired has expanded from tech workers in San Francisco to sales, marketing, and other professionals in 15 cities. The company has acquired two small startups in Paris and Melbourne to help it continue expanding internationally. Patel said he\\'s constantly looking for ways to cut costs. The startup has moved three times in as many years because it was unwilling to commit to a long-term lease. The chairs at the company\\'s San Francisco office are mostly from Ikea. Patel said he bought a Herman Miller model for his home office from a startup that shut down during the first dot-com crash. \"That\\'s still my office chair,\" he said. \"It reminds me not to let things get too crazy.\"',\n",

This kind of regression is exactly why the company stock is at an all-time low; investors are concerned about slowing user growth and the resulting engagement. Those same investors are bracing for the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings this week, and it could have used a nice Super Bowl boost to highlight on the earnings call.

The company said results were released about 3 hours ahead of schedule during trading hours on Monday, due to an error by PR Newswire, leading to a spike in volatility in its shares. Yelp also said Chief Financial Officer Rob Krolik would step down later this year but did not elaborate. Krolik, who joined in 2011, will continue in his role until Dec. 15, 2016, or until a replacement is hired, the company said in a statement. Yelp's revenue rose about 40 percent in the fourth quarter, topping analysts' estimates, helped by the strength in its advertising business and a rise in mobile usage. Local advertising accounts in the quarter rose 32 percent to about 111,000, in line with estimates from market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Revenue rose to $153.7 million from $109.9 million. Yelp reported a net loss of $22.2 million, or 29 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $32.7 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.\",\n",

The Indian government plans to push through Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application to set up outlets, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t public. The company is resubmitting the request as it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the right format, the person said, without giving a time-frame for final approval. Apple should qualify as a provider of cutting-edge technology, the person said. That would exempt the maker of iPhones and iPads from a rule forcing foreign businesses that retail a single brand in India to procure 30 percent of a product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inputs locally. The company makes most of its devices in China. Cook is hunting for fresh sources of growth after Apple last month forecast a sales decline for the first time in more than a decade. India now has the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fastest-growing major economy and about 220 million smartphone users. The challenge is that Indian consumers tend to prefer cheaper devices, leaving Apple with only about 2 percent of the market. Apple uses re-sellers in India for its products.

Revenue will be about $820 million in the first quarter, and $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion for 2016, the company said in a statement Thursday. That missed analysts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 average estimate for $867.1 million and $3.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LinkedIn had 414 million users in the fourth quarter, up from 396 million in the prior period. While Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner has made investments to diversify the business, like acquiring education website Lynda.com for $1.5 billion last year, it will be a while before those efforts contribute meaningfully to revenue. In the meantime, LinkedIn is facing a slowdown in its marketing-services business, which companies use to find potential customers, show them ads and relevant information and generate sales leads. Sales to recruiters, who use LinkedIn to find candidates for jobs, are also slowing. LinkedIn is narrowing its focus in some areas, which is hurting sales. For example, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discontinuing a tool that helps marketers find leads, incorporating the technology into its sponsored content business instead, contributing to a slowdown in its marketing solutions business. Revenue in the marketing solutions division rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter to $183 million. The professional-networking website is also facing slower economic growth in Europe and Asia, though it said China is its fastest-growing country for new members. The company has a standalone app for Chinese users and has devoted much of its efforts over the past year to push deeper into that market. For the fourth quarter, LinkedIn reported a loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.43 million, compared with the average estimate for $50.2 million.

The cutback on routine IT services is likely to push firms including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd to sharpen their focus on high-margin digital services, analytics and artificial intelligence to cushion the impact on earnings. India\\'s IT and software services export revenue is likely to grow by 10-12 percent in the fiscal year beginning on April 1 to as much as $121 billion, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said.

Dropbox is not laying off workers or shrinking; it hired nearly 500 people last year, 75 since the start of this year, and it plans to soon move into a sprawling, custom-designed office building for which it has signed a long-term lease. But that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the image of Dropbox you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d encounter in the news media. Two years ago, the company raised a round of financing that valued it at $10 billion, making it one of the most highly prized start-ups of the tech boom. Now it faces a stock market that has turned unfriendly to initial public offerings of tech companies, not to mention stiff competition from publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Google and Box, the similarly named firm in a similar line of business. As a result, Dropbox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s valuation has been battered by a series of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarkdowns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from large investors who appear to have turned skeptical about its future. For instance, the mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price now considers Dropbox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares to be worth half what they were at the time of the last fund-raising round. So what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying? Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fate that other Silicon Valley start-ups may be facing, especially with the dip in public and private markets for funding tech ventures. Dropbox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems have less to do with the strength of its current business than with a delay, so far, in realizing the towering expectations that once surrounded the company. The start-up is like the college basketball star who manages to turn pro but is still regarded with doubt because everyone has now realized he might never be the next LeBron James. What happens to a company once thought to be worth $10 billion when it turns out to be worth only $5 billion, or $2 billion? According to Dropbox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executives, nothing too terrible \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron. The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.',\n",

Mr. Singhal, 48, joined Google in 2000 as employee No. 176. A native of India, he has a doctorate in computer science from Cornell and worked at AT&T Labs before Google. One of his earliest jobs at Google was rewriting the initial breakthrough algorithms developed by Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google was one of many search engines, but it distinguished itself both in the quality of its results and in building features like spell check, which could offer correct answers to misspelled queries. The early engineering team also developed search-related tools for its advertising, which quickly turned into a very profitable business. Unlike some other early Google employees who scaled back their efforts or left the company altogether, Mr. Singhal appeared to remain fully engaged in advancing search.

Independent booksellers, though, are seeing sales growth in many parts of the country, showing how reluctant some book fans have been to give up browsing store shelves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are all kinds of studies that show the best way to find things when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for is an old-fashioned bookstore,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Mutter, editor in chief and co-founder of Shelf Awareness, which publishes an email newsletter for booksellers and librarians. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a major part of what Amazon is trying to do with this bookstore in Seattle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " b'Yahoo to look at job cuts, alongside spin-off:\\xc2\\xa0 After its core Internet business has continued to flounder, Yahoo says it is now exploring \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrategic alternatives,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which could imply a number of things \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including selling off its core business to another company, as was previously reported. Basically, this is an acknowledgment that things are not working over at Yahoo proper. The company released its full-year earnings today that showed, once again, flat earnings growth, and a series of products that still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t breached mainstream stardom. All this, taken together, is something that has investors very displeased. The company also said it was laying off 15% of its staff, including closing some international offices \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which TechCrunch previously reported \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as it continues to figure out what its core business looks like in 2016. Following the report, the stock basically went nowhere, meaning all of this was baked into expectations for the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earnings report. Mayer dismissed accusations of excessive spending, denying what she called an inaccurate report of a $7 million bill for its holiday party, saying the figure was exaggerated by a factor of three. Yahoo reported a 15-percent drop in adjusted quarterly revenue - after deducting fees paid to partner websites - to $1.00 billion from $1.18 billion as it struggles to keep its share of online search and display advertising in the face of tough competition.',\n",
       " b'Alphabet, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close in on Apple:\\xc2\\xa0Wall Street got its first glimpse of the financial details of a new conglomerate called Alphabet on Monday. Investors liked what they saw so much that the outfit formerly known as Google is poised to become the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most valuable company. Alphabet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014. Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core business is performing. The new disclosures, combined with its more investor-friendly tone and, of course, continued strong growth in its advertising business, are the main reasons Alphabet stock has jumped 43 percent from a year ago, putting it neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere. Or at least that was what happened with Amazon, which recently began separating its retail operations from the results of its highly profitable cloud computing business, and Netflix, which used segment reporting to show investors that while it might be losing money internationally, its North American streaming business is doing well. Advertising continues to account for the lion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising. This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.',\n",
       " b'Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Moonshots Cost Lots of Money, but Running Google Costs Even More:\\xc2\\xa0For years, Larry Page told Wall Street he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blowing all of Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money on crazy bets like self-driving cars and smart contact lenses. Turns out, he was right. If the first dual-structure Alphabet earnings showed us anything, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that the biggest costs for the Internet giant are not from its various non-Google projects. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re from Google itself. Case in point: In 2015, capital expenditure \\xe2\\x80\\x94 servers, real estate and stuff like that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ran $8.85 billion for Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core business. Cap ex for the Alphabet remainder \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the self-driving cars to the Fiber broadband business to two biotech companies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was far less, at $869 million. Operating loss for those units was just north of $3 billion. That is, Google spent more than twice as much on its basic ad business than on its change-the-world projects. The reason? Running core Google is still expensive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 particularly the massive data server infrastructure, which remains part of Google. So is its very large and very expensive research division, despite the fact that lots of that work, like its artificial intelligence and VR efforts, end up in other Alphabet projects, such as autonomous vehicles.',\n",
       " b\"Google Parent To Overtake Apple as World's Most Valuable Company:\\xc2\\xa0Google parent Alphabet Inc. is poised to become the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most valuable company, taking the crown away from Silicon Valley rival Apple Inc. after reporting higher profit and sales fueled by a booming advertising business that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporting ambitious new projects. Alphabet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shares jumped as much as 9.4 percent in extended trading, putting it on track to surpass Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market capitalization of $534.7 billion. The Web company has been inching closer to the iPhone maker as investors lose confidence in Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smartphone business and wager that Alphabet has a clearer path to growth. Apple first passed oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. as the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most valuable company in 2011. By changing its name and structure last year, Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page has put the focus on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main Web business while giving more insight into investments in new areas such as artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, health technology and fast Internet access. Even though Apple has also been building expertise in cars and AI, the secretive company has kept much of that under wraps. With iPhone sales slowing and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth engine sputtering, Apple is on pace to post its first revenue decline in 15 years. Alphabet sales are estimated to climb 16 percent this year. The shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet rose to $843 in extended trading from $770.77 at the close in New York, suggesting that the Web company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market capitalization will exceed $550 billion when trading resumes on Tuesday. While Apple generates more than triple the revenue and profit of Google, investors focus more on future prospects than past performance. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a market truism that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s particularly acute in the technology industry, where new breakthroughs can rapidly undercut previously reliable business models. Apple and Alphabet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ascendance to half-trillion-dollar-plus valuations illustrates the premium investors put on U.S. technology companies. Five of the nine most valuable companies in the world are from the industry -- Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com.\",\n",
       " b'Evernote Will Shut Down Market, Its E-Commerce Effort, On Wednesday:\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Some more news from Evernote \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the note-taking app and startup of the same name \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that speaks to the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current rough patch: today it announced that as of Wednesday at 6pm Pacific, it will shutter Market, the e-commerce platform where it sold Evernote swag and Evernote-integrated office products, in an attempt to create another revenue stream around its more dedicated users. Separately, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also learned that there is another senior departure at the company: Ronda Scott, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime head of comms, is leaving at the end of this week. The moves come at what has been a pretty difficult period for the startup. Developments have included a number of senior departures, including that of the previous, longtime CEO Phil Libin; other underperforming products getting axed, and the startup \\xe2\\x80\\x94 once commanding a $1 billion tag \\xe2\\x80\\x94 among several whose valuations have more recently been marked down by large fund managers. In a blog post announcing the news today, head of partnerships John Hoye wrote that the move is being made as part of Evernote\\xe2\\x80\\x99s restructuring around its core business as a software \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not e-commerce \\xe2\\x80\\x94 company. Evernote is a startup based around keeping documents in the cloud \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and eliminating the need for paper. So when the Market and its focus on notebooks and other products was introduced in 2013, it did feel a little out of left field. A year after that the company said it had sold some $12 million in goods through the store. And today it updated that with other numbers: over 800,000 Evernote Moleskine notebooks, 300,000 Jot Script styluses and nearly 20,000 ScanSnap Evernote Edition scanners. But at the end of the day, it seems those numbers did not really meet the costs of maintaining the operation. So now that Evernote is calling time on all frivolities; trying to get back to the heart of what made the startup so popular in the first place; and driving more premium users \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which are up 40% on a year ago, a spokesperson tells me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the decision to shut the Market was probably an easy sell at the startup.',\n",
       " b'Microsoft Plumbs Ocean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Depths to Test Underwater Data Center:\\xc2\\xa0Microsoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill. Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash. Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity. The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity. Such a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage. The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users. The company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eight feet in diameter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected. The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night. The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Azure cloud computing service.',\n",
       " b'Tech Valuations In 2016: The End Of The Line For Sloppy Growth:\\xc2\\xa0What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in technology investing right now? Is this another 2001, when tech imploded? Another 2008, when the wider world crashed but tech powered through? Or is it like Facebook in 2012, a valuation blip and a chance to buy? High-growth companies have attracted \\xc2\\xa0high valuations, which allowed them to raise capital, which was then spent to generate still more growth and raise the valuation again. The result has been a self-perpetuating cycle of high burn, higher growth, still higher valuations and a strong positive feedback loop. The slop has been showing up in the numbers. The valuations of public companies already reflect this - valuations of public tech companies crashed 18 months ago. In March 2014, these high-growth companies were being valued at 12x run-rate revenues, but by mid-2014, this had declined to around 6x revenues, which is where it has remained since. The long-expected crash has, in fact, already happened \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almost 18 months ago. \\xc2\\xa0Unlike the private markets, the public markets get to rethink investment decisions every day. Over time, public investors either explicitly or implicitly realized that customer economics and the quality of growth have declined and, consequently, reduced the premium paid for excess growth. Capitalism works. The private markets, where decisions only get made once a year, have been slower to react; hence, the dearth of IPOs and the price adjustments seen as high-priced private companies come to the public markets. In 2016, any private tech company where the last percentage points of growth have only been generated at the expense of profit will no longer be able to attract capital at a high valuation. Smart companies will respond by cutting marginal investment, thus raising sales efficiency \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even at the expense of having a lower growth rate. We will then see the same feedback loop kick in, but in reverse. Lower valuations will result in less capital being raised, which will result in lower growth and still-lower valuations. In contrast to the rise, the decline will happen much more quickly. Bubbles build up slowly, crashes happen fast. Eventually it will bottom out as growth rates become sustainable at acceptable levels of customer economics. Sloppy growth will be out. Sustainable, smart growth will be back \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least until the next time.',\n",
       " b'Theranos is running out of time:\\xc2\\xa0When Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive officer of Theranos Inc., sat down for an interview last month, she sought to address reports that sparked serious doubts about her company\\'s innovative blood-testing technology. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we need to do now is focus on the technology and focus on the science and the data and put that out there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Holmes said in an interview for a Bloomberg Businessweek cover story. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause that speaks for itself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: Since then, investors, critics, and members of the medical community have been waiting. And waiting. And the news just keeps getting worse. The most recent blow comes from an inspection report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which found that Theranos\\'s lab facility in Newark, Calif., is in violation of regulations on five counts. As Bloomberg News reported, the company\\'s testing center inside a Walgreen\\'s pharmacy in Palo Alto, Calif., has been temporarily shuttered and turned into a ghost town with a sign taped out front saying it\\'s closed \"until further notice.\" The company\\'s response to this new crisis is the same as it has been all along: It says it is on top of it. How much longer it can keep saying this without losing its credibility is unclear, but it\\'s safe to say that time is running out.Holmes and her story of upending the blood testing market were so powerful that Theranos was granted a $9 billion valuation through recent investment rounds and attracted a VIP roster of politically connected board members from outside the medical field, such as Henry Kissinger and William Perry. Theranos did much of its fundraising from 2003 to 2015, in the midst of an inflating Silicon Valley bubble, when billions of dollars in investor money was sloshing around. The environment has become much more difficult over the past six months, and the company may be running out of time.',\n",

The results, as well as the company's determination to invest more in new areas and its extremely low profit margins, brought back perennial questions for investors about the company's ability to consistently earn money. Amazon's net profit for the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, rose to $482 million, or $1.00 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $214 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 21.8 percent to $35.75 billion, but missed analysts' expectations of $35.93 billion. Net sales from its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, rose 69.4 percent to $2.41 billion, compared with a growth of more than 78 percent in the third quarter. AWS continues to be the fastest growing division within Amazon. The company's total operating expenses rose more than 20 percent to $34.64 billion in the fourth quarter.\",\n",

On an adjusted basis, revenue fell to $25.69 billion but beat analysts\\' estimates. Microsoft generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States. Microsoft\\'s net income fell to $5 billion, or 62 cents per share, in its second-quarter ended Dec. 31 from $5.86 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from the \"intelligent cloud\" business, which includes products such as its Azure cloud infrastructure and services business along with other non-cloud products such as traditional servers, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. Perhaps a better indicator of its cloud strength is what the company calls its combined cloud business, on track for $9.4 billion in annual revenue, the company said. That measure, which includes Azure plus other businesses like Office 365, is up 15 percent from the $8.2 billion revenue it estimated last quarter. \"They nailed the cloud,\" said Matt Howard, a venture capitalist at Norwest Ventures who monitors Microsoft closely.',\n",

The shares dropped 3.8 percent to $66.92 in New York, bringing their loss for the year to 18 percent. While gross merchandise volume on Alibaba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chinese retail marketplaces rose 22 percent to 964 billion yuan ($147 billion) in the three months ended December 31, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less than the 28 percent increase in the prior quarter.\\xc2\\xa0 Revenue and earnings per share beat analysts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 estimates in the fourth quarter because Alibaba was able to sell more ads to its merchants and better capitalize on its Tmall and Taobao platforms, he said. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s troubling is the decelerated growth in GMV, most worryingly at Tmall, where it was 37 percent this quarter, compared with 56 percent growth the previous period, Cordwell said. Plus, the boost in sales from advertising came from Alibaba catching up on monetizing its mobile platforms, a phenomenon that will end, he said. Sales of 34.5 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) rose 32%, and outpaced expectations for a 27-percent rise. The proportion of revenue Alibaba gets from outside China fell to 6 percent\\xc2\\xa0',\n",

At the time, the social network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambitions were high: Parse would be Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way into one day harnessing developers to become a true cloud business, competing alongside the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Those ambitions, it seems, have fallen back to earth. On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shut down Parse, the services platform for which it paid upwards of a reported $85 million. At one point, Facebook was willing to take those risks. When Facebook bought Parse in 2013, Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock was below its initial public offering price of $38. The company had not grown a robust mobile advertising yet, and Facebook was eager to seek out other lines of business in hopes of future profits, according to two people with knowledge of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plans at the time who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company. Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone. Things have changed. Facebook is generating record profits and its mobile advertising business is booming; 80 percent of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advertising revenue now comes from mobile devices. As Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fortunes have turned, it has shown less interest in pursuing other lines of business outside of what it does best. Instead, the company appears intent on building things that somehow, someday, will feed Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core ad-based business \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and those bets are going to have to get bigger and weirder Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.',\n",
